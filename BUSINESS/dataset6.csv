A2YKADCJME4FSW,B00E5XLZM0,Tom Birkenstock,"[5, 5]",When was the last time you heard a drum solo on a new album  Think about it  Drum solos have long been relegated to the realm of live albums from 70s rock gods like Led Zeppelin or of overreaching prog bombast from the likes of Rush  Well on Fuzz8217s debut selftitled album a drum solo appears a little over three minutes into their song 8220Loose Sutures8221  But more surprising than the inclusion of a drum solo in an album released in 2013 is the fact that I didn8217t immediately recoil  Like many I8217ve long accepted notions of musical aesthetics that decried bombast for its own sake  If anything Fuzz8217s debut could convince a new generation of musicians and listeners that it8217s time to reassess what we value in modern rock and rollWhile I may be overstating my case somewhat8212after all bands like Queens of the Stone Age Comets on Fire Woods and The Black Angels all borrow from classic rock radio8212there8217s still something invigorating about hearing Fuzz8217s unabashed instrumental noodling  And if anyone can make us rethink what8217s currently fashionable in rock music it8217s probably Ty Segall the incredibly prolific artist who not only produces his own albums at breakneck speeds but also seems content to collaborate with whoever is willing to pick up an instrument and play  The songs on Fuzz give you the sense that they morphed out of epic basement jam sessions  But what saves these songs from accusations of excess is the fact that musicianship always serves the songs  8220Sleigh Ride8221 contains a hook that continually whips the song forward to its conclusion and album opener 8220Earthen Gate8221 evolves from the primordial goo of its opening into a fully formed rock riffPerhaps the key to Fuzz8217s success is that despite the call backs to early 70s protometal it also doesn8217t pretend that the last forty years of music hasn8217t happened  With a little tweaking the shortest song on the album 8220Preacher8221 could be transformed into a bona fide punk shredder  And unlike most rock music from the 70s that were looking for bigger and better studio sounds Fuzz has a distinct lofi element  In a sense Fuzz might best be viewed as another variation on the sound of Seattle grunge whose members like Mudhoney and Soundgarden seemed perfectly happy to break down barriers between classic rock and punk  Whatever ingredients were used to concoct Fuzz8217s curious brew the results are undeniably engaging,4.0,Classic Rock in 2013,1388275200,"12 29, 2013",1

A1GQKT156RW0WA,B00BSO2U1Y,R Gerard,"[11, 12]",It should be stated at the outset that this recording is not and does not presume to be one comparable to those of Serafin and Callas and the like  To compare this recording to older ones like Serafins would be as futile as comparing Klemperers St Matthew Passion to that of John Butts  Rather it is acknowledged by the artists and by the accompanying materials that the present recording attempts to do something novel for this opera  replicate as closely as possible the forces and practices that Bellini might have intended  Gone are the large forces with rounded sound quality and voices having to project over them past their healthy limits  Norma was after all written only four years after the death of Beethoven  Norma is temporally closer to classical performance practice than later showpieces calling for the innovations of Boito and Verdi for which greater pressures on the voice were required  It is time for the works of Bellini to be put in context which is what Bartoli and Antonini attempt here  The differences which are reflected from this are not only inherent but intentionalThis recording was always bound to open a Pandoras Box of operatic politics  Praising this recording is not mutually exclusive with disrespecting the exalted status of Callass  It would be like praising new recordings of Bachs keyboard works on harpsichord while having to discount musical giants like Glenn Gould who recorded the same works on a modern piano  Rather it is probably most useful to take this recording of Norma and examine it according to its own merits  After all nothing like it has been done before though notably Callas herself used smaller more intimate forces for her recording of NormaOrchestra La Scintilla provides expert period accompaniment here  While some critics question the orchestras relatively extreme dynamics as compared to the rounded sound of a modern orchestra this quality is precisely one that that makes a baroque or classical orchestra distinctive  The thinner gut strings which produce a clearer line the woodwinds which are capable of a clearer more reedy less hollow tone are capable of producing sudden dynamic changes that modern instruments cannot produce  It is a quality that in some ways compensates for the reduced forces  Not to say the sound is anemic  quite the contrary  The sound is always full and under the baton of Antonini La Scintillas playing is always dynamic and forwardthrusting  The tempi chosen give new insight into the compositional qualities of the work  Take for example the last minute or so of the overture where the ostinato strings pulsate over sustained chords played by the woodwinds a relatively faster tempo here though not too brisk brings out the melody in the woodwinds and an almost Mozartian quality to the strings which support them  In other recordings that take this section at a much slower pace such qualities are muddled and the structure is cloudedCecilia Bartoli is not Callas  Bartoli does not presume to be Callas  Bartoli attempts to do honor to the roles creator Giuditta Pasta who by contemporary accounts of her voice was probably a strong mezzosoprano  In doing this Bartoli does an amazing and memorable job  She ranks as one of my favorite modern Normas todate remembering importantly that Giuditta Pasta was not Maria Callas either  We can argue opera politics again over whether or not Giuditta Pasta was or was not a mezzosoprano but on this recordings own merits Bartoli has offered us a characterization of Norma that is believable angry conflicted remorseful all rolled into one fiendishly difficult roleSumi Jo as Adalgisa was wisely chosen  The clearness of her voice is a stark contrast to Bartolis darker texture a wonderful representation of the younger priestess for whom the older Norma is scorned  One of the highpoints in this entire recording is their duet in Act II reminiscent of Bartolis performance with Natalie Dessay in Mozarts Mitridate  The clarity and control is very good and passages where the two women sing in thirds are oftentimes ravishingJohn Osborn as Pollione is less of a standout than the women but he executes his role very well  Much has been said of the singers being smaller voices Osbornes above all  But that was the point  The call for reduced forces with the realization of Bellinis likely performance practices and notice of the appropriate limits for the human voice refer to the liner notes in relation to the evolving size of the orchestras was an essential consideration when making this recording rather than a mistake or pretextual justification for shortcomingThere is much to recommend here  It is decidedly a different take on an old bel canto classic but it is far from taking huge liberties from Bellinis intentions  This recording is one that pleases open ears and perhaps those interested in musicology and period performance opera politics aside,5.0,Opera Politics Aside a Very Good and Important Recording,1375747200,"08 6, 2013",1

A8QCB68UL50NX,B000025558,Subterranean,"[22, 23]",And you might fall in love with Kid A  Maybe  Its a love it or hate it album  But I can unconditionally recommend giving it at least one try especially if youre a fan of OK Computer or Hail to the ThiefWhy  Because Kid A is Radioheads true masterpiece thats right even more so than OK Computer  It takes the rulebook and rips it clean in two managing to be so many different things in so many ways that its almost indescribable  Thus this review will really wind up being a short guide to listening to Kid A then a trackbytrack overview to give the reader some concept of what experiencing the album feels likeHow To Listen to Kid A1 Expect the UnexpectedAs many shocked listeners discovered when Kid A was released it is NOT OK Computer  It is a Radiohead album make no mistake but it sounds like nothing youve ever heard before  In a good way  Do yourself a favor and leave any concept of what you might hear at the door  Form your own experience of what you hear and allow yourself to be startled by it  Its OK the waters warm2 Listen to the Entire AlbumAt least once  Kid A flows more than any previous Radiohead work  its supposed to be experienced as a single cohesive whole the only possible break being Treefingers which acts as an intermission of sorts  Its shorter than OK Computer  you can do it set aside 49 minutes and do the album justice3 Give it TimeKid A is an album that absolutely refuses to give everything up on first listen  Youll need to engage it actively if you want to enjoy it completely  Does music always have to be work  No but in this case its well worth the troubleTrack By TrackNOTE This is for those who are still unsure that they will like the album and are skittish about making the initial investment  Its a brief overview done mostly for my own pleasure  Expect spoilers01 Everything In Its Right PlaceThis is actually a typical Radiohead opener in its own way completely different from the rest of the album it nevertheless launches you instantly into the proper context for hearing everything else  Beginning with a single synth line that ascends upwards towards an uneasy apprehensive standoff that somehow reminds me of Thus Spake Zarathrustra the listener then encounters the first new element on this album Thoms vocal track has been put through a blender then reconstituted into something thats part human part jigsaw puzzle  As these hackedup bits of sound are dubbed over the normal vocals theres an odd sense of both tension and stasis  Its the traumatic shock in the immediate aftermath of a great tragedy and Thom cant find the words to describe it  As the tension and volume builds the mangled tracks multiplying the song suddenly resolves into the same synth line with which it began adding some modulationpitch bending in the right channel  The track is both calming and disturbing two seemingly opposing traits that will continue to mingle throughout the album02 Kid AThe title track opens with a sound like a UFO slowly coming to hover above the ground only to be replaced by a nurseryrhyme melody played on what could be tubular bells  This mix of the earthly and unearthly is what defines the song  When deep reverbladen synths and muted 808ish bass drums kick in the effect is something like being transported back to the womb only to find it completely alien  The vocals have once again been altered  this time strained through a distorted vocoder that makes them sound like a cross between an old analog recording and some extraterrestrial along the lines of ET  The song is almost lulling and comforting except for some odd squeaks that sound like dissipating air and one single jarringly dissonant sample in the middle carefully calculated to throw the listener off hisher guard  Then just as the song sounds its most innocent and hopeful a sample fades in of a baby crying which in turn crossfades to a single eerie highpitched note  This is counterbalanced by a guttural synth sound that leads directly into the next track03 The National AnthemThis is where the album begins to sound slightly more like traditional Radiohead  that is until the brass section enters  It begins with a simple antagonistic bassline gradually adding drums odd samples ambient noise a highpitched synth and a brief vocal track  Then out of nowhere a low brass rhythym enters eventually rising into squalling trumpet and finally a chorus of different brass instruments all playing in different keys at different times  Imagine John Coltrane Miles Davis Charles Mingus and a number of other notable brass soloists blasting away at the same time on their respective instruments without any regard for what one another is playing and you begin to get the idea  The track is eaten alive by the brass section only to briefly echo in a distorted orchestral arrangement that ends on a minor chord setting the stage for the albums early climax04 How to Disappear CompletelyThose who study Radiohead will notice a pattern emerging  The fourth track is always a slow haunting ballad which usually winds up being one of the albums most powerful tracks  How to Disappear Completely is the culmination of a number of studies in creepily beautiful ballads  It begins with almost inaudible strings playing an unresolved minor key  almost subconsciously setting your teeth on edge  Gradually an arrhythmic acoustic guitar fades in meandering down minor progressions which heighten the uneasy mood  Thom enters quietly in the lower part of his falsetto range as heartstopping downward glissandos provoke palpitations  Im not hereThis isnt happening he sings quietly  From there the track slowly crescendos by turns achingly beautiful heartrending and nervewracking  Its equal parts crisis and catharsis revelling and worrying over one terrible moment  If Kid A is as Yorke puts it something traumatic then this is the definitive moment of trauma  All those who accuse Kid A of being inhuman listen carefully  Radiohead have never been more fully committed spiritually and emotionally than in this song05 TreefingersAfter the intense ordeal of the last two songs the listener is confronted with long rounded synthlike sounds actually played on guitar then cutandpasted in postproduction  It reminds me of sunlight glinting through the branches of underwater trees kelp or coral I dont know  Yet even this ambient work so soothing is slightly troubling as well  In the end Treefingers serves as a fullstop a brief intermission between first and second acts a chance for the listener to catch hisher breath06 OptimisticThis track is a somewhat startling jolt after the ambient nature of the last one  The listener is immediately launched into the most satisfyingly normal song on the album  if anything sounds like OK Computer on Kid A this is it specifically its the best parts of Electioneering rearranged to form an even more biting and sarcastic song  Try the best you canTry the best you canThe best you can is good enough Thom taunts sardonically after commenting on how the big fish eat the little ones  Its the bitter medicine to the everyone is special method of child rearing that has infected the world today  The track is mostly powered by the fivepiece guitardriven dynamic that made Radiohead famous although towards the ending it dissolves towards an interesting jam with jazzrock tendencies  It ends with a crash cymbal segueing directly into the next track07 In LimboAfter a brief stuttering synth intro tumbling drums and unsettling guitar arpeggios set up a chaotic composition  The vocals wailed over these tides of instrumentation only increase the feeling of unease  This was one of the most disturbing songs on the album for me  Between the creepy intonation Youre living in a fantasy world reminiscent of the Dream on line from the film Jacobs Ladder and the howls of GO AWAY that are distorted into meaninglessness at the songs end its pretty frightening08 IdiotequeCombine a moody ambient synth with stuttering Aphex Twin beats and challenging vocals and you have the ultimate feelbad antiDance electronic track  Given all that Idioteque is still pretty entertaining and surprisingly singabledanceable during some bits in its own morbid apocalyptic way  One could spend ages simply dissecting the intricacies of the squeaks and scratches that form the songs beat  The lyrics are mostly oblique although some say that they deal with the threat of global warming  The only thing thats really clear is that this song is the foretelling of the inevitable apocalypse that gives the album its name Kid A is the term for the first child born after an apocalyptic event  The track ends on a prolonged dissonant chord which dissolves into the next song09 Morning BellIf you oversimplified Kid A down to just a concept album with the title track representing birth How to Disappear Completely representing teenage years Optimistic being the greedy beginnings of adulthood and Idioteque being the concerned years of middle age then this song would most likely deal with the central characters old age or senility  Thats not to say that it sounds aged or senile  it just seems to express the ramblings of a senile mind  Between the disjointed nonsensical lyrics mumbled by Yorke in a nervous falsetto whisper the shredded guitar peals in the background and the splintered drums theres a general impression of disorder briefly shattered by a sudden crescendo halfway through the song where suddenly all the disparate elements of the song seem united in a single purpose only to evaporate back towards minimalist unrest finally fading to just a synth chord and a groping muted bassline10 Motion Picture SoundtrackKid As grand finale starts with just an old organ pumping away at chords that sound older and wiser than time  The vocals come slowly patiently heartbreaking in their steady intensity  I think youre crazy Thom sings in a manner that sounds like anything but disapproval  Theres a brief measure of rest then unearthly sounds like a childs toy or an alien spaceship trickle upwards and downwards over the vocal track eventually supplemented by an equally ethereal operatic voice rising upwards into oblivion To some it may be slightly reminiscent of the soundtrack at the very end of The Elephant Man  It drives me to tears almost every time I listen to it the unlikely duet straining upwards towards the heavens as Thom sings I will see you in the next life  The tinkling jackintheboxlike instrument then slides from the top to the bottom of its range before spiraling off in random tangents slowling fading into silenceThis silence lasts for roughly a minute before it slowly fades into feedback replaced by the sound of strings tuning and the lifts of an enormous choir collapsing into cheerful electronic beeps  Perhaps this is the next life of which Yorke sings  If so we only glimpse it for thirty seconds before there are two more minutes of silence and the album repeats,5.0,Scrap Your Preconceptions and Open Your Ears,1145145600,"04 16, 2006",1

A3VQLTB724O77W,B000003CVX,Dr Christopher Coleman,"[47, 48]",Eine Alpensinfonie dates from a time and place now past when a respected composer could literally write for any orchestral forces he desired  It is scored for a huge orchestra 150 instruments by one countalthough not 150 different instrumental parts and includes hecklephone windmachine thundermachine tenor tubas and 20 French horns12 are offstage and play only in 21 measures of the piece for less than one minute It is a veritable bible of orchestrationStrauss is a master of handling huge forces surpassed only by Gustav Mahler and that arguably But Strausss layers of counterpoint and his textural conceptions can suffer at the hands of overenthusiastic performers or an insufficiently aware conductor  Andre Previn and the Vienna Philharmonic prove themselves more than capable though and this is an absolutely beautiful performance that always brings tears to my eyes  Following the score while listening to this recording demonstrates an astonishing clarity of performance in such a complex score and if the low brass tone crests a bit on occasion it is surely Strausss intentionotherwise he would not have written two trombones and two tubas on a pedal G  fortissimo  That passage cannot and should not be played delicatelytrust me Im a trombonist  Worthier of note are the fantastic performances by the first trumpet who Strauss treats as almost superhuman the gorgeous horntenor tuba section and the fantastically lush sound overall  The performance is not without flaws but the problems are minor indeed and issues of interpretationfor example at the very ending Previn does not observe Strausss fermata and the violins never really glissando noticeably where Strauss indicates to do so  The final interval of a twelfth a compound fifth from F at the top of the treble clef staff to Bb below the staff is marked glissando what is meant here is a slide from one note to the next without break and consequentially the F and the notes before it will likely be played on the G string resulting in a dark sound very appropriate for the ending of the piece the ending section is even titled Night  But the Vienna Philharmonic or Previn or both see it otherwise  The glissando is inaudible to me there is no connection between the penultimate and the final note and the final phrase is not I believe played on the G string at all  Still this is quite a subtle distinction and not one that significantly mars the overall performance of truly deep and powerful musicStrauss has been criticized for being overly programmatic and literal writing trivial music and being derivative of Richard Wagner and Gustav Mahler  Whatever truth these criticisms hold the fact remains that Wagner Mahler and Strauss revolutionized music  Aside from their already wellknown harmonic innovations and orchestral mastery they freed melody from its primarily vocal conception which had limited it from its origin  Where most composers before them would follow a large leap with motion in the opposite direction thereby restricting the melodic line in musical space these three composed great soaring lines in which a large leap might well be followed by another leap or stepwise motion in the same direction  The resulting themes often surpass the range of a single instrument a given melody might for example begin in the tuba doubled with bassoon celli and contrabasses move to French horns and finally end in the upper registers of flutes oboes and violins  Orchestration becomes not simply an assigning of instruments to particular lines but an inseparable part of the composition of a piece  Whatever flaws Strausss music might have and I have to admit that the Storm Scene in the Alpine Symphony with its wind and thunder machines and the portrayal of raindrops in the pizzicato strings is too cliched for my taste its glories far surpass themIt is a bit of a shame that nothing is coupled with the Alpine Symphonyat only 48 minutes this disc is a bit slim and I think that Death and Transfiguration would have made a stunning companion piece  But perhaps Previn and Vienna have already released a version of that work at any rate even alone this is an excellent performance of a glorious piece and well worth owning,5.0,Glorious Recording of Gorgeous Music,1024444800,"06 19, 2002",1

A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B0002KQOG2,LA Scene,"[3, 3]",When it comes to the band Van Halen I may be in the minority when I say that I feel they became a better band when Sammy Hagar was brought in to replace David Lee Roth as the lead vocalist  When it comes to showmanship David Lee Roth would be a tough act to follow  However Sammy Hagar brought something else to the table  the allaround quality of musicianship  It was that musicianship that elevated Van Halen to even greater heights of creativity  It was that same musicianship that could not be replaced when Gary Cherone was later brought into Van Halen to replace Hagar  I subscribe to the notion that sometimes the best thing for a mature band is to bring in an outsider to join the band It gives the band fresh ideas and a new perspective I look at the case of the Rolling Stones bringing Ron Wood in Ron Wood did much more than play Bass he became a significant contributor to the band To me Sammy Hagar like him or not injected some new life into the Van Halen band and became a significant contributor  much like Wood did for the Stones Hagar doesnt just sing hell contribute to the songwriting and production of the effort of Van Halen  Like Ron Wood Sammy Hagar had already proven himself to be an accomplished musician  This album Sammy Hagar The Essential Red Collection provides great insight into not just Sammys pre Van Halen days  but Sammys entire career outside of Van HalenOne thing that amazes me is that The Essential Red Collection is a single CD of 20 tracks comprising 78 minutes of music  You certainly are going to get value on this CD  For the most part The Essential Red Collection is going to focus on Sammys 1980s and 1990s solo career  It also contains some of the Soundtrack work that Sammy has done  There are also two unreleased tracks and a track he did with his previous band MontroseIt is also worth noting there are other compilations out there  When considering The Essential Red Collection it probably pays to compare and contrast what this has to offerRematch  This was a greatest hits compilation that was released in 1982  While it does contain songs that are on The Essential Red Collection Red Ive Done Everything for You and a live version of Montroses Bad Motor Scooter it also contains a lot of Hagars 70s work that is not included on The Essential Red Collection  Albums such as Nine on a Ten Scale Musical Chairs and Street Machine are not represented on The Essential Red Collection but are found on this collectionBest of Sammy Hagar Capital Records  Released in 1992 this is another collection that compliments The Essential Red Collection  The same three songs overlap this collection that overlap Rematch  Red Ive Done Everything for You and Bad Motor Scooter  This covers Sammys work while with Capital Records before moving to Geffen Records  The big difference between this Best of  and Rematch is that Best of includes Sammys cover of Otis Reddings Sittin On The Dock Of the Bay  Sadly this cover was omitted from The Essential Red CollectionUnboxed  This collection was released in 1994 and covers Sammys work with Geffen records  There is no overlap between Unboxed and the two Capital Records compilations Rematch and Best of  Most of the songs on Unboxed are included on The Essential Red Collection  The four songs that are not included on The Essential Red Collection are Buying My Way into Heaven Babys On Fire  Three Lock Box and I Dont Need LoveDespite many of the songs that are in some of these older compilations that arent included The Essential Red Collection brings some unique things It is the only Sammy Hagar compilation that bridges his Capital Records work with his Geffen Records work It is the only collection that includes Soundtrack work that Sammy has done  Fast Times at Ridgemont High title song The Girl Gets Around from Footloose and The Winner Takes it All from Over The Top It includes two unreleased tracks from the early 1970s Thinking of You and Call My Name It includes three songs from his 1990s work Little White Lie Marching to Mars and Mas TequilaOne thing I like is when a greatest hits collection arranges its tracks in chronological order  This allows me to see how the artist has progressed over time  Even though there are some gaps in The Essential Red Collection Sammys late 1970s work and his Van Halen days it is still a very good thing that the tracks have been arranged chronologically  This still gives some sense of how Sammys career has evolvedMost importantly though  The Essential Red Collection truly will entertain you  Each of the tracks does a great job at showcasing Sammys talents  This reaffirmed my theory that it was Sammy Hagar that took a group like Van Halen to the next levelThe liner notes truly do justice to this compilation  In addition to the CD packaged in a unique Red tinted jewel case there are lots of extras  Ted Nugent writes some introductory words  Scott Schinder writes a terrific biographical sketch of Hagar  focusing on his solo career  Finally each of the tracks are listed with their songwriters mostly Hagar production credits and most importantly  what album each of the songs came from  Overall this is a terrific snapshot of Hagars career  If you arent familiar with his work outside of Van Halen this is the collection to get  You can always compliment it with the Rematch or Best of collection to get some of the earlier work  The only negative I can think of his the exclusion of  Sittin On The Dock Of the Bay  Otherwise a highly recommended collection,5.0,The best Sammy Compilation Out There  Confirms his talents as a Musician,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",1

AO2AQRPPSTABB,B000001E81,Jeffrey JPark,"[0, 0]",Released in 1995 this is a fine album of ambient music from The Orb Alex Paterson Andy Hughes and Thomas Fehlmann  Although not critically well received upon its release I actually enjoy Orbus Terrarum a great deal and appreciate the more soothing and atmospheric aspects of the music  In large part it is very easy to put this album on and let it melt into the background if the listener chooses toThe seven tracks on the album are pretty long four tracks are in the 1020 minute range which is perfect for this type of music  In large part the music consists of fizzing and bubbling tone colors and sequenced rhythm parts generated on banks of synthesizers and other electronic devices  Guitars and acoustic instruments are used as well including the piano  Indeed the appearance of the acoustic piano on Oxbow Lakes 728 provides a startling dynamic contrast to the smooth and nearly static ambience of the first two tracksSamples and found sounds are employed including prerecorded snippets of the human voice on a few tracks  The last track Slug Dub 1703 is a good example of this and features prerecorded and electronically altered voices that narrate a tale of some troublesome garden pests slugs in amongst some quasireggae inflected rhythms  It is all fairly psychedelic actually and a fine example of ambient dubAlthough the pieces generally exhibit little variation with respect to timbre and melodies are both delicate and used sparingly the music is not as static as one might expect  There are enough albeit subtle variations in dynamics the booming lower frequencies are great that it makes for a reasonably interesting listening experience  Moreover while an integral part of the composition yet never too insistent the rhythmic element spices things up considerably  which may reflect a Terry Riley influenceAll in all this is a fine album of ambient music that is slightly more rhythmically charged than other ambient albums that I have listened to  Music for Airports Brian Eno 1978 and Rainbow Dome Musick by Steve Hillage 1979 come to mind in fact  As a longtime progressive rock fan looking for newer and interesting music this provided a fun listen and presents a nice update on the ambient style,4.0,Interesting update on the ambient style,1210204800,"05 8, 2008",1

A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B003S9GOWS,I Giles,"[16, 17]",This set caused me some doubts as one reviewer has stated that the mastering of this set is exactly the same as the late 1990s mastering so if you have the previous copies which I do then it would be a waste of money to buy this setRegardless and tempted by the 24 bit processing stated on the rear of the box I decided to take a chance I have compared every disc with the previous mastering one by one and doing an AB comparison and there is absolutely no doubt that this set is superior The tonal range is warmer and far more believable and the slight woodenness of piano timbre which was still apparent on the last mastering has now been removed The somewhat dry acoustic remains which makes the recordings sound as if they were made in a small and wellupholstered room This could well reflect Chopins actual original playing circumstances in many cases of course so can be acceptable on that basisMuch may depend on the replay equipment of course and in that regard I have three ranges of equipment at different levels of fanaticism All reveal the improvement with the best equipment showing the most improvementAs regards the performances I have supplied full reviews elsewhere but can summarise these readings as followsRubinsteins view of these works can generally be described as coolly dispassionate and he can be very tough in this regard This is all to the good as in this way we get to hear what Chopin wrote without the distracting effects of superimposed emotional interpretations A great deal of the writing is surprisingly discordant and it is impossible to avoid being aware that Chopin was if not unhappy at least he could be described as suffering from disquiet on a significant number of occasions and this shows in his musicRubinstein makes this quite clear in his versions of the sonatas the ballades impromptus and scherzos for example He is not the only one to take this view Perahia can be uncompromising in these ways as can Ashkenazy Pollini and Argerich for example I choose these pianists simply because their views were strongly influential on discs as long as forty years ago and the softer more emotional and salon approach to the music soon became unacceptable from then on Perahias version of the preludes came as quite a shock to me in its uncompromising emphasis of the discords when I first heard it in the 1970s and it changed my understanding of Chopin at that time Other works such as the mazurkas and nocturnes are not so colouredI would suggest that this set by Rubinstein is valuable as a corrective to excessive emotionalism in this music and thus provides a good starting point from which other versions can be investigated This is not the only way to play this music  no one pianist or musician can ever claim to have the only answer to interpretation Nevertheless this is a set of such importance that it should not be ignoredAt this price and in this new remastering which I suspect is dated around 2010 when it was published in this boxed set this represents amazing value I personally find the disc of the preludes too old to be rewarding and the concertos are better played by other combinations of pianists conductors and orchestras but the rest are marvellously rewarding recordings from the stereo eraSome dialogue from the comments section that may offer further helpI thought that you might like to know that before I buy a recording I now look through all the reviews to see if you have posted one Your assessments and opinions are invaluable Thank you US reviewI

A262TFY27XMQS3,B000000IRB,howzat howzat,"[2, 6]",Dark Side Of The Moon 1973 Pink Floyds eighth studio albumThere has never been and never will be a band quite like Pink Floyd Over their extensive career the prog rock quartet of Dave Gilmour guitar Roger Waters bass Rick Wright keyboards and Nick Mason drums have made a legendary contribution to rock music Ive also not forgotten original frontman Syd Barratt in that list The band tried out more than their fair share of new ideas and in many ways paved the way in pushing the boundaries of music All of the bands albums are quite popular but none more so than Dark Side Of The Moon which is heralded as the Floyds greatest work and one of the greatest albums of all time This album has shifted more units than any other rock album ever made sales are over 40 millions units I think So is this album really deserving of its great popularity and also why is it just that bit specialFor me there is no question this is Pink Floyds ultradefinitive album and also their finest album  other hardcore Floyd fans may disagree and choose Wish You Were Here or The Wall by preference but I think that this tops them both Pink Floyd up to this point had amazingly demonstrated their great potential none more so than in their great 1971 release Meddle With that album you could sense that the band were on the brink of producing a true masterpiece and here you have it the ultimate masterpiece from the band in Dark Side Of The Moon Everything comes together on this album the songs run cohesively and perfectly from one to the next and the songwriting is literally awesome It should come as no surprise that all of the band members had songwriting inputs on the album rather than the sole Waters dominance that would come in later albums and this further demonstrates why this album is so good It often amazes me that there are people around today who are more than willing to bash this album I constantly hear comments such as It sounds dated or This music makes me fall asleep These people probably listeners to senseless nu metal emo crap or anything else thats abysmal in music in recent times never fail to amaze me I dont know what stuff they must be on to make them so diluded At my last check this album was made over 30 years ago  YES 30 YEARS People are quick to diss the techniques that Pink Floyd used on this album to make various effects but at the time it was completely new and revolutionary  they didnt have the latest digital recording studio to help them out That aside the various styles the band use on the album for me still sound fantastic and fresh Gilmours guitar work is first rate as are his vocals Waters bass play is beautifully resonant throughout and the keyboard work by Wright is fantastic With that all aside it is the lyrical concept that really makes this album so good Pink Floyd take you through an amazing conceptual journey on this album and one that you never tire of The all too realisitic themes of loss of time war madness and death are in this album The band tackle a whole load of themes in this 40 minute album you cant not be emotionally moved by it This is why the album has appealed to so many over time the albums concept driven experimental but ultimately polished and structured style is what makes it shine so much The album has so many sides to it and you notice something new with every listen Who also could miss the cover the prism effect front is simple but an amazing eyecatcherThe journey of the Dark Side Of The Moon begins with opener Speak To MeBreathe The opening part of the song opens up with a showcase of the effects to come mad voices a woman screaming cash tills and everything else all cleverly mix together note all the voices you hear on the album were workers at the recording studio who had their reponses recorded when they were asked about madness This then runs into the start of the proper music firstly with the classic guitar and bass line for the album followed by a couple of verses of harsh and brutal lyrics On The Run is a clever track with a racing electronic sound which was created by speeding a note sequence on a tape loop  theres plenty more effects added in on this track Then we come to the albums first epic in Time A surpise entrance of ringing bells kick starts this one Gilmours crunching guitar chords alongside some echoing drumming give this song an atmospheric build up This then becomes a lyrically amazing song with themes on time slipping away and growing old Gilmours guitar solo is brilliant as is the Breathe reprise song exit Following this great track is the closing song for side one with Great Gig In The Sky Rick Wrights gentle piano chords are superbly contrasted by the passionate emotional and evocative wails by singer Clair Torry who the band hired for the song The song is like nothing Ive heard beforeThe second half of the album opens with the albums most famous song Who could fail to recognise the unique cashmachine sounds at the start of the song Rhythmically this song is weird as it is written in 74 time as opposed to the 44 standard However this time signature paves the way for the songs classic bass line The lyrics based around corporate wealth greed and acquisition are classic as is the middle section with plenty of roaring guitars Us And Them follows perhaps the albums most heartfelt song Based on the theme of outrage at the continuation of the Vietnam war this song is powerful The keyboard work is imaginitive and the saxophone solo is brilliant Any Colour You Like is next This one is experimental where Gilmour tries his hand at some quirky guitar play over some great keyboard dubs The madness theme of Brain Damage is next up which looks at the mental damage caused to war casualties This is another foreboding song with a brutal and realistic edge Finally to close this epic album is Eclipse A short punchy finish with plenty of contrasting lyrics building to a climax The heartbeat at the end cleverly trails the album to a finish in the style just like it beganDark Side Of The Moon is an epic musical journey through the tragedies of life Pink Floyd were at their absolute peak with this album and the work is never short of inspired moments This album is perfect everything comes together both musically and lyrically Plenty of people have this album but still if you dont then this is a MUST buy This album is not just the place to begin a Pink Floyd collection it is the place to begin a good music collection in general Trust me and all the other high rated reviews for this album this album is well worth the money you will pay for it and the time you will spend listening to it excuse the punsEXTRA NOTE Dark Side Of The Moon was issued in an SACD format some time ago If you have the technology for SACD formats then this is the version you may want to get I personally dont know what the quality is like with that version and Ive heard a mixture

AQ7V1UO19U1N9,B002BWYRH2,John Rossi,"[0, 0]",The title I chose for this review I used because these places are where this CD takes me in my head and my heart This is terrific solo debut CD from Jeff Endemann  whose voice and guitar playing  I am convinced the world needs to hear plenty more ofIts difficult for me to get poetic here and do a track by track rundown here but that is chiefly because I feel that Mr Endemanns guitar playing and melodies  are some of the best Ive heard and his voice is that of a bard penning and delivering lyrics that are no less than pure poetry for the soulThe Serpent Speaks to me has a Middle Eastern feel and drips with mysticism that that I loveGoodbye To Avalon  is a tearjerker if Ive ever heard one and Ive heard plenty of them in my years on this Earth It has me in tears as I write this a beautiful ode to a lost and mourned way of life in a different and simpler timeFalling Leaves seems to be a song of searching for the self going by the chorus  The melody is lovely and though it is not a country song it does put me in mind of of balladeer or cowboy singing from the heart and singing from the heart is a beautiful thingShadows of Sherwood Forest is another jaunt back to the days of yore Exotic percussion guitar and lute or mandolin or perhaps both do a happy dance with bardic vocals to put me in mind of an ancient troubadour Lyrically and melodically this one is a heart wearmer that puts a smile on the face and a spring in the stepThe Funeral Procession of the Gypsy Queen is a somber march played out ancient percussion mournful guitar and voice  Images of robed figures perhaps Druidic come to mind carrying torches as they traverse a forest bearing the body of their beloved Queen to her final place of rest  Music that can paint pictures in the mind as Mr Endemann can do is a wonderful thing to experienceShe Lies Beneath the Rose is my other favorite on the disk with Goodbye to Avalon being the first I love songs that to me hearken back to ancient days and I hear one of those right here Again the guitar melody is a thing of beauty as is Mr Endemanns delivery of poignant lyrics depicting the parting from this world of a beloved soul and perhaps also the passing of an idealWinter is a pleasing warming ode to the coldest of seasons delivered with a warmth that is felt in the heart for me  It paints for me a picture of either a loved one or perhaps the Earth itself Hints of  the cyclical nature of life and death dance through the piece going from there to the return of life and back It is a picture that is beautifully paintedSo Far  to me is a perfect piece of road music I dont say that because of tempo but because it puts me in mind of someone driving across the country through the open road during the evening time watching the sunset moon and starlight as they ponder the human condition  Images of campfires on beaches come to mind too Lyrically it makes me think Melodically its gripping and vocally it is beautifully deliveredLullaby The Sun Is Slipping is a piece that touches the heart and drifts through the soul in a way that few things Ive heard have done for me The beauty of the guitar and vocal melodies make me joyful for those out there who are fathers and call to mind what a blessing parenthood is also making me thankful to God for the man He gave me to be my own earthly father For that I am grateful as the song is a reminder of true blessing and one of the greatest joys a man can ever know on this EarthIn closing I do believe the world needs to hear more of Jeff Endemann and if you havent do yourself a favor and try this If you allow yourself the courage to be touched your heart will be touched by this release,5.0,To Other Lands and to Ancient Times,1276646400,"06 16, 2010",1

least SOMETHING you dont find enjoyable hereIn case you dont know Tantric is the somewhat new rock band formed from the bulk of the members of Days of the New minus the singer  You may remember them from their 9798 hit single Touch Peel and Whatever  If you cant already tell I didnt really care for them much  That opinion might change now but back in the days of 97 an era I commonly refer to as Worst Year for Music EVER I really wasnt digging those guys too much  Anyways for whatever reason DOTNs singer decided to part ways with the band at which point they hired Hugo Ferreira and formed the band Tantric  And so began the beginnings of one of my new favorite bandsFrom what I have heard of Days of the New and I have admittedly heard little Tantrics sound is a bit different  This is also something a little bit difficult to answer mostly because they sound like sound like a heck of a lot of the best parts of many many different bands  I guess you could think of them as a collaboration of the sounds of Creed Alice In Chains Nirvana Soundgarden Lifehouse Radiohead Pearl Jam Coldplay and a whole slew of others that I could go on forever mentioning  Dont be shyed off if you dont really like one or even a few of these bands because Tantric also possess a sound so distinctly theirs that you dont even really notice the similarities to said bands youre too busy enjoying what youre currently hearingWhen I first heard this cd I had borrowed it from a friend who himself had purchased it on the strength of the single Breakdown  If any of you like most of us dont sleep on top of a bed full of money with several beautiful women and cant afford the risk then you know as a cd buyer that this is something commonly poopood upon  Couple this with the fact that my friend in questions taste in music is somewhat I guess you could say superficial then you can understand I wasnt exactly sure what I was in for when I popped this is the cd player  Well by the time I had gotten through only a few tracks I realized that my friends musical risk had paid off in a big way he had discovered one heck of an albumTantric is a really good album  I mean REALLY good  By that I mean REALLY REALLY good  As in surprisedtherearestillmainstreamradiobandsaroundwiththismuchtalentgood  This band and this cd is one of the few these days that really deserve all the attention that has been given to them and for all of it and theres not really THAT much I mean Im sure quite a few people wont even remember who they are until they release their second album they deserve so much more  I hope these guys rise way above the five minutes of fame status most Top 20 rock radio bands recieve today theyre much better than that  If you cant take my word for it you can ask my friend the casual rock but mostly rap listener or my other friend the nonstop speedmetal listener or you can ask my boss the mostly Doors with a side of The Who listener or you can ask my dad the classic rockforgotten grunge and straightforward rock listener or well Ill stop there but just know Ive got truckloads of emIm sticking to the bold claim I stated earlier and will say for the record that no matter what types of music you enjoy you really can find something to like here from the catchy acoustics of the single Breakdown to the allout rocking power of Frequency to the depressing yet beautiful melody of Mourning somethings bound to click  I really cant tell you just how awesome this album is it blows me away every time I hear it its just so extremely welldone  The band claims to have poured their hearts and souls into each song and it really shows  Every track here is awesome but if I had to pick specific favorites it would be the single Breakdown still one of the best hits radio has had lately the intoxicating Live Your Life Down the simply gorgeous ballad Mourning Astounded which cant be described as anythind else but pure Tantric and the emotionally charged Hate Me  But picking favorites isnt fair because I love the other seven as wellYou really dont have anything to lose by just giving this band a shot and picking up the cd something I think anyone with a yearning for really creative and emotional music should do  Whatve you got to lose fifteen bucks  Cmon pick yourself up off your bed of money and beautiful women and go pick up the cd you really cant go wrong  After that you can join the masses of people like me awaiting Tantrics second cd,5.0,Finally  A Universally Acceptable Rock and Roll CD,1026777600,"07 16, 2002",1

A6FIAB28IS79,B0000047D9,Samuel Chell,"[2, 6]",No Lester isnt overrated  But this widelyacclaimed recording isexcept perhaps to those who are already familiar with Lester and have followed his career up to this meeting with Oscar on a highfidelity longplaying record  As a young teen I first saw Lester in 1956 at a JATP concert in Milwaukee  All I remember is the sight of a wobbly woebegone creature who was blind drunk apparently clueless about where he was  Although he blew into his mouthpiece a few times I couldnt hear a sound and I remember his leaving the stage only with help from supportive musicians  My next introduction to Prez was this recording  By that time I had acquired a generous collection of Gene Ammons Sonny Stitt over 20 albums Dexter Gordon and Johnny Griffin  Consequently this encounter between Lester and Oscar was insufficient to clinch the case for Prez as one leg of an historic triumvirate of tenor titans with Hawk and Trane occupying the other two positionsIn 1939 Hawk recorded Body and Soul which became practically an instant classic In that same year Lester recorded Lester Leaps In with an expanded Basie rhythm section  The latter recording was largely ignoreduntil Woodys 2nd Herd brought us the Four Brothers and Stan Getz who practically channeled Lester durling the last half of a Ralph Burns instrumental that became a bonafide hit Early Autumn Gradually but unmistakably it became increasingly clear why it was Lester perhaps more than any other musician who made many aspiring musicians choose the tenor saxophone ahead of any other instrument Lester had become a school unto himself and at a time when the music was leaving the popular limelight and the cultural mainstream in favor of an increasingly countercultural direction  He was the personification of this new alternative ultra cool music its been written that it was Lester who popularized this apparently ineradicable permanent addition to our vocabularyDespite the irresistible pulse and swing generated by this Oscar Peterson rhythm section I cant help but sense that Lester is occasionally scrambling on his horn just to keep up  Moreover his sound doesnt have the foundation or body that is present even on his airy freefloating highregister flights on the Basie recordings from the late 30s  On this 1952 recording hes on the cusp of sounding a trifle fragile occasionally somewhat tentative and frail  In other words I find myself in complete disagreement with those many reviewers and critics who vehemently denounce received wisdom that Lester had lost his luster in the 1950s  In their devotion to Lester which in itself might be seen as testimony to his influence and attraction they feel practically dutybound to challenge the customary line on Lester or mythie that he was a sensitive artist whose humiliation at the hands of racist military superiors led to mental depression alcoholism and above all diminished creativity and facilityTo some degree the evidence supports their caseie that Lester returned to form playing better than ever  Listening to Lester between 1946 and 1949 is to hear a far more powerful aggressive even virtuoso saxophonist one who frequently uses the lower register of the horn  The Lester Young Trio from 1946 is an especially enjoyable session with Nat King Coles piano accompanying and soloing as imaginatively as Lesters tenor while Buddy Rich plays tastefully yet on top of the beat to a degree not found on the more flawless and polished but also more predictable and less engaging Benny Goodman Trio recordings with Teddy Wilson and Gene Krupa  And when you get to the 1949 JATP session with a rhythm section of Hank Jones Rich and an inaudible Ray Brown Lester leads off Lester Leaps In with an agile imaginative solo that practically rivals the ensuing burst of creativity from the alto saxophone of Charlie Parker  Ill go with the Lester apologists up to this historical point even though a few may argue that following his court marshal and subsequent dishonorable discharge from military service Lester abandoned some of the key principles of the cool school that he had founded rather that saying more by playing less he often seems intent on proving hes up to the challenge of the beboppers even overcompensating should circumstances warrant improvising that verges on the pyrotechnicalI still prefer the light high freefloating sound of Prez before the war but thats a personal preference His mastery of his instrument is unassailableat least not at any time during the first half of the last century  But the question about his playing throughout the 1950s seems far more controversial  Ive read that most listeners are attracted to Billie Holidays recordings from the 1950s rather than to her stellar Columbia recordings of the 30s and early 40s  Its understandable that for the same reason some listeners may be similarily moved by Prez recordings from the 1950s  Each performance represents a kind of victory over ironclad internal and external forces each represents a shout of defiance in the face of destiny  decline and mortality itself  There are those who defend the performances of both Billie and Prez on the celebrated Sound of Jazz CBS telecast from 1957  Frankly after these many years I find the performances of both a trifle depressing which is not what the bluesFine and Mellow should ever be  In the same year Prez was featured at the Newport Jazz Festival as soloist in a Basie reunion concert  He plays both Lester Leaps In and Polka Dots and Moonbeams as though they were his last breathwhich was not far from the truth  To my ears he sounds like a musician  who has with plenty of liquid assistance fortified himself in order not to incur embarrassment  His sound is relatively secure but its also forced calcified woodenformulaic phrases emanating from a programmed orifice  If you enjoy that Lester youll be enthralled by the more buoyant and creative Lester of this 1952 Verve recording  But hes no longer he old Lester the perpetually young hip cool Lester who ultimately became the President of the tenor saxophone during the first half of the last centuryIf Lester failed to retain office at the beginning of the centurys second half it was less a question of his keeping up with the many eager and able younger players a flock owing no small part of its existence to Lesters example than of maintaining the standards he himself had created  Lester showed the rest of us how you could be conspicuously even stubbornly different from your peersan innovator a quiet yet forceful influence a creative artist always at the forefrontwithout running away to form your own band playing radically original music  Whether in or out of office Prez was one of us  After many Dukes Counts Kings Birds Hawks etc we finally had a creative giant who was not royalty or some sort of nonhuman species  Lester Young perhaps more than any other musician in this musics history epitomized a  delicate balance between individualism and community that is the very essence of an indigenous liberal as in changing democratic art  And thats jazz,4.0,Overrated Lester the Presidents real story,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",1

A1P8PX35O5JHLQ,B000002G7G,Scott E Browning raven,"[1, 1]",The Velvet Underground formed in 1964  From 1964 to 1966 the group became inventive and managed to team up with artists like Andy Warhol and Mary Woronov and form the Exploding Plastic Inevitable  This led to touring around the country and eventually the fashioning of their debut album The Velvet Underground  Nico in 1967  In 1968 the group split from Andy Warhol Nico and The Plastic Inevitable and released the album White LightWhite Heat  Both albums were innovative and intense for their time boasting from fairly quiet sounds to extremely loud ones  Then Lou Reed and John Cale were butting heads with each other as far as decision making  Its hard when you have two musicians like these each of whom are bullheaded working together  Neither one likes being told how to make his own music  The tensions between Lou and John were so intense that eventually one of them has to leave  In this case it was John  Later on in 1969 the group recruits a new musician Doug Yule to play bass organ and do some vocals  Also this led Lou to mellow out on this collection of songs  On the selftitled album also known as the Grey Album the mood is quieter This allows Lou to express more emotion  The song What Goes On boasts a moderate drum tempo by Mureen Tucker an efficient organ background by Doug a somewhat bagpipe guitar solo by Sterling Morrison and of course Lous smooth guitar playing and lyrics  It is a definitive rocker  The same thing can be said about Beginning to See the Light which has great acoustic guitar sounds  The following songs are slow but not at all boring  Candy Says Some Kinda Love Jesus Pale Blue Eyes and Im Set Free  The Murder Mystery is the biggest surprise  Here you get to hear Lou and Sterling in wich their voices overlap each other  Then you hear Doug and Maureen sing lines back and forth  Plus you hear an innovative use of the organ where Doug sometimes vibrates the keys  Towards the end the song changes to repeated piano keys while Lou and Sterling once again having their voices overlap one another Thats the Story of My Life is the shortest song of the album but is wellpaced with all musicians blending all instruments together at a moderate tempo and a fairly soft tone  In the song After Hours you just have Lou playing guitar and Maureen singing for once  Her voice my not be up there with someone like Celine Dion but it is adequate  I dont think Lou was expecting a pure and radiant singing voice from her  Throughout the album you hear sounds which are reminicent of the doowop groups as well as artists like Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley  But of course Lou does not try to imitate them  He attempts to see how they apply to his lyrics  Moreover the subject matter is anything but family entertainment  The song Candy Says Im told tells about a man who does not enjoy his own gender and has a burning desire to be a woman  In The Murder Mystery you have all these descriptive and surreal lyrics depciting tha aftermath of a murder that took place  In the song After Hours you have a not so fortunate person inside a bar just trying to make the best of things and wanting the front door shut until the day is done  Hopefully the next day will be better  Once again I think The Grey Album is where Lou Reed expresses his more tender side but at the same time keeps the listener tuned in  Even though the album is quieter its still a masterpiece with lots of intensity  This intensity is evident without the benefit of extreme loudness and distortion so prevalent on the bands previous two albums  Its just too bad this album like the other Velvet albums did not sell even though Im told that the critics back then praised it,5.0,A Quiet Album with Lots of Intensity,1193788800,"10 31, 2007",1

A26MQ4YGVS5CC2,B00C4XYEFS,Todd Bartholomew,"[38, 40]",The time is 1962 and Kennedys Camelot is in full flower  The White House wanted to thank that summers interns for their service and what better way to do so than a Rose Garden concert with the Dave Brubeck Quartet and Tony Bennett  Both performers were at their zenith with the world on a string around their fingers  Jazz aficionados have long salivated at the thought of what this concert must have been like putting these two incomparable performers together  The excitement over the performance swelled the size of people wanting to attend requiring a larger venue so the concert moved to the nearby Sylvan Theater by the Washington Monument  On a balmy late August night the setting and the performers truly had to be a show to remember but sadly while the concert was recorded the tapes of the show were lost  What was lost is now found and its sad that this comes out so shortly after the great Dave Brubecks passing yet its a great reminder of what an innovator he was and how sharp his Quartet was at the time  That all the performers were so sharp and up to the task is testament to their skills and talents as they had no time to rehearse and the entire concert set was largely put together on the fly  While individually the Brubeck Quartet and Bennett were confident in their own sets the two were going to perform together and neither had done so before  Talk about a high wire act  But as supremely talented performers this high riskhigh reward gamble was likely to pay off and it does so in spades  Early on in his set Bennett appears a bit taken aback and nervously says I dont know whats going to happen but wish me luck  Clearly luck was on everyones sideBrubecks Quartet opens the show demonstrating their intense improvisational skills and swinging like theres no tomorrow  Their hit Take Five opens the set and then the Quartet takes the audience on a global tour with Nomad Thank You and Castilian Blues all knowing nods to the Quartets service as global ambassadors of American music and their service overseas to a grateful government  Thank You in particular is an often overlooked gem by the Quartet and here they play it with a gleeful abandon that is truly captivating  By the end of Castilian Blues I truly didnt want the party to endtheres so many other songs from that era of the Quartet Id love to hear and Im sure the audience was dying for more  As a kid Id never cared much for Tony Bennett but as time passes I realize what a genuine talent he is  That honeyed voice and his incomparable phrasing is truly a beauty to behold and hes holding forth in rare form here  His take on Make Someone Happy here is probably the best version Ive ever heard and his take on One for my Baby is likewise top shelf  Bennett is in his element and just killing it  The money shot here is the final third of the show where the Quartet returns to back up Bennett on a romp though the classic American Songbook and here is your high riskhigh reward playing out and paying out  Together they remake and remodel such classics as Lullaby of Broadway Chicago That Old Black Magic and There Will Never Be Another You with such finesse and virtuoso performances that youre dying when the show ends  Surely there must be an encore Can they play a few more  Sadly no and listening to this I could almost imagine myself sitting on The Mall taking this all in and screaming for more  Im sure the audience did too and so will you What makes this recording so memorable and beautiful is that it captures these artists in full flower in front of an ecstatic audience in a truly memorable venue giving what may perhaps be the performance of their lives  The sound quality is actually quite good given the limitations of live recording equipment at the time and the whole thing fairly crackles with life and vitality  Being able to sit in and listen is the rarest privilege and treat and one I want to repeat again and again,5.0,I dont know whats going to happen but wish me luck,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",1

A1RJJ56MBJMX87,B00004ZEU2,Gavin Wilson,"[6, 6]",Upon the breakup of the TV Pythons John Cleese studied the fundamentals of French and Italian farce in order to create the outstanding Fawlty Towers Michael Palin and Terry Jones went back to boyhood adventure stories to devise the brilliant Ripping Yarn parodies and Eric Idle teamed up with exBonzo Neil Innes to write the Rutland Weekend Television RWT series for BBC2  Borrowing most of its name from a genuine TV station London Weekend Television RWT anticipated the unstoppable rise of regional television produced on a shoestring  Several comic teams have copied the idea since for instance the DeaytonPerkinsPopecreated KYTV  I saw many of the episodes of RWT but its no coincidence that they were rarely if ever repeated and that the series has never made it to video  The sketch failure rate was very high on RWT far higher than even late Python episodes  We watched RWT less for the jokes and more for the anarchy  The Rutles started off as short spoof pop video for one episode and got expanded into this 70minute minifilm documentaryThe Rutles was an exception to the rule that a single sketch cant be built up into a full series or film  It worked brilliantly  Until buying this DVD I had only seen the film once  on its original UK broadcast at 845 on 27th March 1978  but I was instantly overcome with Rutlemania buying the LP and writing off to WEA for any posters or Rutle merchandise they could send meIm sure the Rutles documentary helped to define the classic visual moments in the Beatles only story  George Harrison was closely involved in the project so it had the stamp of approval of at least 25 of the original Fab Four  According to Erics commentary on the DVD both Ringo and John also enjoyed it  I suspect that Paul McCartney had more problems with it Erics imitation of Pauls wideeyed innocence is stunningly accurate and the scene in which Dirk is struggling to compose a nurseryrhymelike song for his nuptials with Bianca Jagger is an incisive and wicked depictionThe jokes such as they are have not stood the test of time  From this evidence Eric comes across as better at networking than at humorous scriptwriting  As is obvious from the stars who appear in the film and Erics constant namedropping on the DVD commentary he has known many of the top stars in the pop business  The improvisational star of the video is really Mick Jagger lying through his teeth and as Eric cleverly points out giving away far too much about his true feelings towards the Beatles and women  The other star is Neil Innes for his songwriting and his Lennon impersonationOne of the best decisions that Idle took for the creation of this film was to play the pop videos pretty well straight without trying to insert many jokes into the performance  Most of the opportunities for visual humour within a mimed pop video tend to be fairly Chaplinesque knockabout and dont last well for the tenth viewing  Not that any of us expected in those prevideo days to be able to see programmes multiple times  In those videos Idle reveals himself as archcopyist so long as you change just a few actions or expressions then copying the original Beatles films as closely as possible is the best way to let the humour in Innes songs to shine through  Innes revealed in a radio interview at the time that his composing strategy was to take the original LennonMcCartney tune and change as few notes as he could get away with without being prosecuted for copyright theft  No doubt Harrison with his subsequent experience of being sued for stealing the tune of the Chiffons Hes So Fine for My Sweet Lord could have helped him hereEric reveals that hes writing a new Rutles documentary though its hard to believe it will be as good as this one  Presumably the onelegged Leggy Mountbatten returns to Britain in response to the teacher shortage announces that he is no longer quite the man he once was and gets engaged to Dirk  Stig sits at home in his fortress having become a vigilante  When hes not waiting with his nuclear arsenal for the next attempted breakin hes busy inventing new media formats beyond CD and DVD to enable yet more rereleases of Rutles material  Nasty can only be contacted via email he runs an Internet Web site which dispenses multifaith blessings and online tea at reasonably exorbitant prices  And Barry has sold his chain of hair salons to present a weekly radio show for the over60s he also does the voiceover for a series of sex education videosThe problem is that too much tragedy has crept into the Beatles lives in the past quartercentury for it to be made fun of  Awareness of personal tragedy may be the key reason why many comedians who hit the big time in their 20s gradually become less funny as they get older and their loved ones dieBut All You Need is Cash is Idle at his postPython zenith not quite in his 20s but close enough  I much appreciate the arrival of this film on DVD and can only lament the fact that I had to visit the US to buy it  This is a region1 only DVD so  those of us in regionX will need to run it on our PCs or multiregion players,5.0,Eric Idles crowning exPython achievement,998092800,"08 18, 2001",1

A1HRZGO57RQU3,B00002Z88D,Randy,"[1, 1]",Ive had this album for a month and I think that it is definitely one of the best of the year I enjoy Metallicas music and their socalled quotselling outquot in 1996 did not offend me I think that it was time  to dump the whole speed metal image and start doing something a little more  refined besides how many different songs can you write with constant bass  and movable chord forms The market was going stale at the time and the  image was not too current This is all somewhat besides the point for I  believe that SampM is an excellent album They do some of their old  classics as well as some of the newer songs Therefore the quotwe were  here firstquot people and the quotunhipquot johnnycomelaters can  enjoy it The orchestra does an excellent job of accentuating the feeling  of the music and made it seem a little bit nobeler It seems that more time  was taken to arrange the music for some songs more than others and for good  reason There is really only so much that you can do with adding an  orchestra to some of the material I think that adding to quotThe Call of  the Ktuluquot was a tiny bit easier than adding to quotFuelquot Its  an excellent production nonethless Its quite admirable that Metallica  wanted to try something new and daring Not too many bands have the balls  to rock out with an orchestra and make it sound good Not only is the  listener presented with a good live music experience as is always presented  by the tallica boys but as previously mentioned a lot more power and  depth is added by the orchestra Some favorites off of this one include  quotThe Call of the Ktuluquot quotMaster of Puppetsquot quotThe  Devils Dancequot quotFor Whom the Bell Tollsquot and  quotOnequot Its hard to really pick some favorites since mostly all  the material is good If I had to pick an absolute favorite I would have  to choose quotThe Thing That Should Not Bequot Their rendition is VERY  evil sounding and has this strange type of Edgar Allen Poe edge to it  truly fascinating James also adds some feeling to the mix with some rants  and laughs you know he was having fun The new songs quotNoLeaf  Cloverquot and quotHumanquot are excellent cuts as well  quotHumanquot is a new venture for Metallica with its low grungy  droppedd type sound which is ironically is a new area of exploration for  the four horsemen a sound which was fought so feverishly by the metal  bands in the early nineties Its an excellent production and really enough  cannot be said to give it justice Maybe the only gripe would be the  absence of quotFade to Blackquot from the lineup That would have been  a big treat Perhaps I would have also traded quotRide the  Lightningquot for quotBatteryquot but thats much too critical and  trivial This is obviously a must for old and new Metallica fans If youre  not a Metallica fan you may want to explore this one anyway it could turn  you into one quickly Amazons price is one of the best around This  experience has definitely given Metallica experience with expanding their  horizons and it shall be interesting to see what their new material should  start to look like after three long years without a large amount of new  material If anything love it or hate it you must admit that this is a  very stylish and excellent way to release a quotgreatest hitsquot album  as oppossed to putting remasters of the old material into a boring  compilation If you dont already have this one you must have a good  reason,5.0,Excellent Stuff,946166400,"12 26, 1999",1

A3N9TOPHBENB9I,B001F5RQQ0,S Harrison,"[3, 4]",Positive factorsFirst of all I was impressed with the weight of the iron  Lightweight irons require the user to press down which to me is more tiring that guiding a heavier iron around the ironing board  To me the substantial weight is a plusI also liked the seethrough water reservoir which allows you to see when water is getting low and prevents overfillingThe iron heats up very fast and produces lots of steamI didnt have any trouble filling it  just poured water slowly into the fill area right from the distilled water bottleThe burstofsteam feature is nice as is the autoclean systemNeutral factorIm a bit leery of all these electronics on what is essentially a very simple device  My oldschool GE steam iron from 1968 still works great after 40 years  How long will this one last 40 years  I doubt it In case you are wondering why I got a new one when the old one still works this one will be used in a different location  This concern is neither a positive or a negative at this point because I have no indication as to whether it will be a problem over the long haul or notNegative factorsI dont like the backlit LCD display You cant read it at an angle  Therefore you either have to tip the iron or bend over and look at it straighton to see what the setting is The blueon blue display is artistic but low contrast only compounds the readability issues LCD calculators are very readable even when viewed at an angle  why cant this be alsoThe waterfill system is inconvenient  The iron has to be flat on the soleplate to fill it  Because the iron produces lots of steam it runs out of water fairly fast if you have a lot of ironing to do or if you are using it at a high temperature  It says right in the instruction book that if you run out of water you should unplug the iron and allow it to return to the standby state before adding more  What  Thats insane Just what I want to do  stand around waiting for the iron to cool down when I just want to get the job finishedWhen I first filled it up a small amount of residual water ran out of the fill areaI cant see anyway to just turn the iron off without unplugging it  It will turn itself off if left inactive on the soleplate or side for 30 seconds or left inactive for 8 minutes when sitting on the heel  If it can turn itself off why cant I turn it off  I usually unplug my iron when I am done with it anyway so this might not be a big deal It just strikes me as peculiarSummary  Im already turned off by the LCD display and the waterfill problems listed above  I am tempted to just give this to my daughter and keep on using the 1968 war horse  However to be fair I will give it a bit longer trial period  If over time I am inclined to like this product a little more I will update this review,3.0,Has some troubling flaws,1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2

A3QL4Z0XZC08ZQ,B00009RAVM,Golf Junky,"[1, 2]",I would rate almost any fan that is relatively quiet moves air and can be disassembled for maintenance higher that 2 stars  Even though this fan seems to meet those minimal requirements it deserves no more than Ive rated and probably less because of other major design flawsEnergy useLow speed  37 watts  Low with grill rotation On  38 wattsMedium speed  40 watts  Medium with grill rotation On  41 wattsHigh speed  42 watts  High with grill rotation On  44 watts Rounded to nearest watt measured by a  KillAWatt EZ meterEnergy Use Note IMO the watt consumption on the Low fan speed setting is excessive On Low I would expect the fan to consume about 25 to 30 watts  The High setting is a low consumption again IMO  Other small fans I have had 6inch to 10inch consumed about 50 watts or more on HighProsThis fan moves air and does that well It is reasonably quietIt has a removable grill on the back attached with Phillips screws so I assume I will be able remove it to clean the blade  This should also allow access to the motor so I can oil the bushings havent done this yet  This is the typical reason my fans stop working the bushings lose lubrication over time and eventually seizeIf it turns out that I can not easily remove the blade for cleaning and disassemble to oil the bushings my rating will be revised to 1 starThe grill on the front rotates only when engaged to change airflow direction to some  degree  similar to standard fans that use a gear to rotate the entire fan head although this fan does not have as much airflow directional change  This feature works but it does rattle slightly when in useRegardless of my minor criticisms I like this feature  It takes up less room than a standard fan when operating the fanhead does not rotate only the front grill and I can turn off this feature if not wanted or if it fails  Also the limited directional change of airflow is adequate for my useConsThe problem is the design  Awful  I bought this fan to mount on the wall  Nope  Doesnt work for meI did not go through the mental exercise of visualizing how mounting this fan would work in practice  I assumed the designers had thought about this since that is a major selling feature  Apparently they didnt think muchIMO the design is terrible for wall mounting  After several dry runs I cant figure out how the design can possibly work well for anyone  Serious modification would be needed for my application and I draw the line at defeating builtin safety featuresHere is why I find the design to be terribleNote that the fanhead will pivot but the pivot angle is set at 45 degrees to the fans base instead of 90 degrees or parallel to it  Also note that the controls are on the right hand side of the fan housing  Although this might be attractive this design interferes with the usefulness of this fan tabletop or when mounted  To the point that the fan is useless to me for mountingSitting on a table top the 45 degree pivot will direct airflow as much up but NOT down as it will sidetoside  This can work on a table top where you can physically move the fan to get the direction wanted  But there is a physical stop in the housing which prevents the fan from pointing down at all  Not goodAs designed the fan is to be mounted on the wall with the fan rotated counterclockwise 90 degrees viewed from the front in tabletop position  Mounting is limited to this one orientation  If that doesnt work for your wall too bad  If that points the fan in the wrong direction the fan portion can be rotated 180 degrees within the housing but it then looks like it is pointing backwards which it would be  Not pleasingIt first appeared that the mounting plates could be reversed to resolve this  Although they can be reversed the fan will not function when mounted this way upsidedown from the mfgs intended mount  There is a safety feature on the fan an automatic shutoff presumably to turn the fan off if it falls over Thus the fan will not run upsidedown  So I am stuck with the one orientation set by the design and would need to turn the fanhead backwards to direct air where I need it  A poor optionIt gets worse  When wall mounted the design forces the position of the controls to be above the fan blade housing  With the bottom of the fan housing mounted at 6 12 feet above the floor my preferred location the controls would be difficult even for me to see or access the controls would then be at about 7 12 feet above the floor Anyone shorter than I would need a ladder to reach them  This ontop control location can NOT be changed again due to the safety shutoff featureFinally when mounted the pivot remains at 45 degrees so directional adjustment of airflow becomes a compromise between horizontal and vertical 45 degree movement  Although this does allow a downward component it still does not work well in my proposed application a galley kitchenMounting would not be easy either  There is no access through the plastic feet to attach the mounting plates to the wall Attaching it firmly to the wall to limit vibrationnoise would also be problematic because the mounting plate system looks pretty flimsyThe mounting method to be used for this fan is to first install 2 screws in the wall into studs or with drywall anchors at the exact location of the mounting slots then slip the fan and feet with mounting plates which are embedded in the feet of the fan over the screw heads  If youve done this before you know it requires accurate placement of the screws and then adjustments of the screws depth to create a tight fit  Not terribly difficult but not very forgiving of errors either  A hole in the drywall in the wrong place and youve created a repair job  Access holes through the fans plastic feet to the anchor plates would make the job easy  But there are noneThe First Abandoned Plan to Make it Work  Just in case you are thinking about thisPlan To reverse the mounting plates mount it at a 45 degree angle for decent airflow directional control and turn the fan upsidedown so the controls are below the fan housing and can be seen and reached  This would also point the fan in the correct direction  Cant do this Safety shut off  Fan doesnt runThe Second Abandoned Plan to Make it Work Plan Place the fan on a high shelf at the end of the my work area table top mode and direct airflow downward  Cant do this  The fan will not allow downward air flow adjustment remember the physical stopSo WhyThis leaves me with five questions about design problems 1 Why isnt the pivot set at 90 degrees to the base or parallel to the base 2 Why arent the controls on the base of the unit instead of on the side which puts them ontop when mounted 3 Why isnt there access through the plastic feet for mounting the unit to the wall 4 Why prohibit reversing the mounting orientation with the automatic shutoff and 5 Why design it so it will not point down at all in tabletop modeIf those problems were corrected the fan could still be attractive and it would become easily mountable useful and actually function as advertised which in my opinion it does NOTEnd ResultI bought it and I will use it But NOT mounted on the wall I bought it for I will use it as a tabletop fan periodI would not buy another nor recommend this fan to anyone except as a tabletop fan and even then with reservations  With one exception  If you have the correct wall to accept the fans required orientation a low mounting height so you can reach the controls adequate carpentry skills and a space that works with the 45 degree airflow pivot this fan would be fineI gave it 2 stars because it is a fan and it does run  I was generous,2.0,Low Rating for Design Wall

A3H9011CL38F67,B0012LG2GM,Vincent Wiley,"[0, 0]",After having the pitcher for two years it is time to review the previous review  My initial review gave this product five stars  I have adjusted it downward to three  The main reason is because the price of the filters had increase tremendously from the initial purchase  Becoming aware of the unhealthy chemicals in our drinking water I also have become aware that filtering using pitchers is expensive and not as effective as I would like Becoming aware that the added chemicals makes the water more acidic filtering becomes mandatory for all drinking water even for the pets Finding that one of the best ways to assist in keeping everyone healthier is to filter I find that the filters only last a few weeks and never make it for a full month I am leaning toward a more permanent inline system and getting away from the annoying pitcher with the annoying hose attached to the faucet system taking up valuable counter top space That the annoying pitcher system is better than the unhealthy nosystem is obviousThe following paragraph is the previous review posted about two years ago  To be fair and to show how the thinking has changed with time I am leaving it up  I mention that the filters seem to last a long time  I have come to realize that if someone were to remove the filter and put it back in the indicator starts over again  It seems to be measuring the quantity of water rather than the current quality of the filterPreviously I had a different filtration and thought that the water tasted strange  I rarely used it After buying a Clear2O pitcher I was impressed with the improved taste of the water The filters seem to last much longer than the other brand The savings from  not buying bottled water which is of questionable quality more than offsets the initial cost and the cost of replacement filtersI have had the initial filter in the pitcher for about fifty gallons of water and was thinking that it was near time to replace it There is a small window which always was green It finally changed to yellow which is an indicator that it is near time to change The filters do seem to last a long time The cost of the filters are reasonable for the amount of water it cleans More so than the previous pitcherOne thing that I would recommend is the extension hose 18 inches for only about six dollars,3.0,Water Filter,1302134400,"04 7, 2011",2

A1EX5SK2PD0XLC,B00110GJ8K,Kenneth Sandberg,"[3, 3]",The item is very attractive with the little wood base its small just a few inches square and it has an attractive little box see the little knob at the bottom that pulls out a little drawer made of wood with the finished coffee grinds  The directions not much really none are on the cardboard box that the unit comes in but the picture of the various parts and how they fit together tells it all  You have a top nut that bolts on to the main shaft beneath that is a plastic type washer then the turning handle then your little inverted metal piece which holds the unit from turning once you have set it up to either fine medium or coarse  You simply turn the piece under this holder piece either clockwise or counterclockwise to adjust the ceramic cutters up or down down for a finer chop up for more coarse  It took me three times before I finally got a slightly medium coarse grind  As others have said if you have problems with strength in your hands this isnt the unit for you  Im close to 70 years old but I lift weights play table tennis and have fairly strong hands  Nonetheless you have to impart a fair amount of strength and effort to make it work  The finer the cut the more effort you must expend  I have found I can grind enough in two tries the little box only holds maybe three tablespoons to make around 16 ounces of coffee using my Chemex  I compared this unit to the two Japanese ones on the market this one is cheaper looks nicer and functions very well it does the job as advertised  My only gripe is the shipping charge was high like around 10 bucksbut they do ship it through USPS and it was well protected  It takes a minute or two to grind the beans depending on amount wanted  Obviously this is not meant to produce a dozen cups of coffee unless you want to spend quite a bit of time and energy creating enough coffee grind to make your coffee but it is perfect for one or two people who only drink a cup or two initially in the morning Update  I have had this little unit for several months and here is some additional observations  First the exact size not the very top or bottom is 3 inches by 3 inches The inner box which holds the ground coffee after the grinding is 1 and 78 inches wide 2 and 12 inches long and approximately 1 inch deep these are the inner measurements of the holding box that determines the quantity of ground coffee you can grind before you start backing up into the ceramic grinding unit First this is slightly less than 4 coffee scoops 4 tablespoons so I usually grind one batch then put in just a little more to make about 4 and a half scoops for my 16 ounces of coffee that I make each morning  The little box fits fairly smugly into the outer shell but not perfectly so a tiny bit of ground coffee gets between the box and the shell  No problem you just gently tap both item after you are done on a hard surface so get the tiny coffee pieces to fall out I do it on the middle of my sink The other observation I have is the grinding handle it is held in place by a nut at the very top of the shaft  After a few times of using the unit the nut will start to unscrew I grind in a clockwise fashion maybe going counterclockwise might stop the unscrewing that occurs its not a problem as long as you occasionally check  the top nut to make sure it is secure  If not just retighten by hand and you are good Oh and the coffee beans are all ground when the handle spins freely with no pressure on it  I really think it is the cutest my faviorite little appliance in my kitchen with real wood and attractive styling  To me it is a real keeper,5.0,Cute practical and simple to use,1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2

A25JMBP75O8J3U,B002I0K5W8,Rick Mallory Jr,"[9, 12]",So here is the deal For me this game came to my attention by surprise and the title itself was kinda in my opinion under the radar in terms of both marketing and publicity At least at firstnow the fact that this game is already sold out first day on Amazon speaks volumes as to how much word of mouth has taken this game So if youve played the demo which is exceptional and still are unsure whether or not to purchase the game then perhaps I can lend a hand and help you make a more informed decisionMultiplayer Okay normally I dont start off with this topic however this seems to be the one that people have the most concern about therefore I feel I must address this first There are basically two different types of multiplayer modes essentially The first type is when you play in Explore mode Technically this is a single player type mode however Ill give it the multiplayer seal of approval because basically in this mode if you have a friend that has played a certain course it will let you compete with a ghost of them Kinda like how back in for example Mario Kart for those of you that have played it or just about any racing game like Gran Turismo for that matter in which you would do a Time Trial and try and race against a ghost of yourself to beat your time Well in this case youre competing against the saved ghost of a friend whether by beating their time or a certain amount of points The other type of multiplayer mode is basically the same thing except rather than being limited to just your friends timesscores you are competing in Global Events against the vast majority of those who ownrent SSX provided they have an Online Pass If youre wondering if this game has athome splitscreen multiplayer capabilitiesI regret to inform you that it does not so if that is a deal breaker toward purchasing this game I would recommend searching elsewhereGameplay In short for what it is its top notch Getting more detailed however there are game modes to endure I already mentioned above the Global Events and Explore modes yet also there is somewhat of a story mode called World Tour mode This is where you can unlock all of the characters although you can also unlock them by purchasing them with ingame credits and also learn the basics of the game and the different types of gear that can be used to enhancehelp you through each course Basically there are 9 regions and also as a PS3 exclusive a Japan Mt Fuji level is included in Explore mode to explore each with several courses that you can play through These courses are split into three categories Race Tricks and Survival The first two are pretty much selfexplanatory and as for Survival that basically puts your boarder up against various extreme conditions and youre given a certain type of gear to help aid you through the challenge whether it be an oxygen tank to help you survive thin air at  Mt Everest or an Ice Axe to help you board more smoothly on overly icy surfaces Each character n the game levels up and as they do so you can purchase new gear to improve their performance I havent seen it all yet but so far there seems to be a decent amount of customization Anyway having said all that there is a lot of replay value in all of this especially if youre into collecting trophies and such Its actually kinda cool to try and outscore or beat your friends recordsa very satisfying feeling if I may say so myselfGraphics Very well done No theyre not phenomenal however you can clearly tell that both time and effort was put into trying to make this snowboarding experience a feast for the eyes All the locations and various weather conditions are accurately portrayed here in this game So if youre the type of gamer where looks are important then I can safely say you will not be disappointed hereSound Overall the sound here is not too bad The soundtrack itself used during the game is actually fairly enjoyable however the voice acting is mildly cheesyalso the things that the characters say is kinda cheesy as wellYet this game isnt suppose to be serious Its a sports fantasy that lets players enact their wildest dreams at the touch of a button so with that in mind Ill let the cheesy factor slide since it is all in good funControls Personally I find them fairly easy to get use to For those of you that may be veterans of the series the game allows you to switch toandfrom an SSX Classic controls setting which is actually pretty neat Yet aside from that I havent really had any trouble with either bad camera angles or controls what so ever which is a definite plusAlright now with that out of the way here are what my scores for the game itself would beGraphics 45Controls 45Sound 55Multiplayer 45Gameplay 55Overall 455To be honest its hard for me to give the game a score of a 455 cause in my opinion that seems a little low It really is a great title and it is a rather enjoyable arcadestyle action experience but then again I have to force myself to realize that it isnt exactly perfectthe multiplayer is great but COULD have been better especially with the use of athome splitscreen Either way these are just my own thoughts and personal opinions on the game Hopefully with this review you can pick up a copy and see for yourself Bottom line Id definitely say to AT LEAST give this game a rent but I would definitely say it warrants a purchase if youre into these sorts of games Update March 4 2012 Alright Ive had quite a bit of playtime with this game since receiving it on its release date and I must say this game truly is incredible I didnt think Id end up clocking in as much time with this game as I already have but life is full of surprises It would be a crime for me to not STRONGLY recommend this game There is nothing quite like that rush or feeling you get when you take down a friends score or beat their time in an event and youd be doing yourself a disservice if you choose not to AT LEAST pick this up as a rental Again I know Im slightly being redundant here but the purpose of this update is to show that my stance on the game hasnt declined in fact it may have grown even betterUpdate March 6 2012 Ive earned 52 of the trophies now for the game there are 37 trophies in all for those wondering so Ive put in a decent amount of time playing this Im going to change my score for the Sound category from 45 to 55 Why Well as another reviewer mentioned you can edit the music that plays ingame with a playlistsongs of your own provided that youve uploaded them onto your PS3 Nothing quite like racing to the sounds of Paradise City or Party Rock Anthem This is a really neat feature that I believe more games should implement in the future Anyway if you have any questions feel free to ask,5.0,A

all things the gameplayBy now most of you are probably familiar with the story but it never hurts to have a refresher of sorts  Desmond is kidnapped by Abstergo  Hes subject 17 and he is hooked up to a machine called the Animus  This allows him to experience the memories of a man named Altair  This was a man who was part of the Assassins in the third crusade  After failing a mission Altair is stripped of his rank and his weapons taken away  The only way for him to work his way back up is to go off and assassinate nine templars to prove himself again  As the plot moves on it becomes a pretty engrossing tale  In particular because so much of it is so well presented  The plot can be a little thick at times and take some time to get to the point but its overall strong  Its also a plus that the voice acting is also incredibly strong tooreally drawing you into this fictional worldUnfortunately this is part of where Assassins Creed can also hit a snag  The world may be a bit too big at times  Not so much the incredibly populated locales but rather that so many of the missions are repetitive  You generally go on smaller missions to find people and interrogate them or something before moving on to your mark  Theres not much variety at all  While the cities themselves are fun to explore the missions make the world seem smaller than it actually is  Theres a lot to explore and some collecting to do but for the most part this is no Grand Theft Auto  Theres a much deeper story here but dont expect to be able to explore a city wrecking havoc wherever you go for some time  Assassins Creed takes itself pretty seriously in some respects  And this is something to love  The cities are detailed with you also being able to look across the landscape to map the data for yourself  On the other hand its quite surprising just how little it feels like you can do after a while  Particularly because of the way you have to go about it  Often times youll have to blend in  Run around and push people about too much and youll alert enemies to your presence and have to fight them off  And this is perhaps where Assassins Creed stumbles the most  The combat is for the most part boringDont get me wrong the combat can be fun but after a while it becomes even more repetitive than the missions themselves  This is because combat is relatively easy  The guards often times will stand by and let you take them on one by one and most times all it takes is just a simple counter and theyll go down easy  And youll go through this again and again and again  The challenge is merely nonexistent  This rears its head even more so when you take into account that most of the bad guys are surprisingly stupid  As Altair you can blend in with crowds  Sometimes this works a little too well as Altair may as well just be invisible  You can sneak up behind a guard kill him and watch him drop to the ground while another guard looks on  So long as you blend theyll never suspect its you  At first its hilarious to see a guard watch you stab someone and then say five seconds later Who did this  After a while however the novelty of such a thing wears off  And this is something that can also be exploited all the time  When youre spotted and run away there are times when things will be a little tough but stand and fight and youll easily emerge victorious  On the other hand running and hiding works just as well  Sometimes so long as you get far enough away you can hide in bails of hay and the guards wont detect you  On the other hand when you run far enough away and just sit on a bench and they cant find you it can break your immersionAssassins Creed is still fun its just that its easy to take advantage of  One of the best things about it however is how one can seamlessly run across rooftops scale walls and jump from one protruding ledge to another  Its pretty seamless and isnt complicated at all  Not to mention if you DO manage to screw up its not big deal  Its also not very sluggish at all or nearly as meticulous as say Uncharted  Theres room for error here and there are often many different places to explore  Guards will often attempt to follow you or hurl rocks at you to knock you down and some will try to follow but theyll still rarely be a match for youThe game is a wonder on the eyes  By far a one of the better looking games in 2007  It was a looker for sure  Particularly the locations  Theres definitely a pulse in the cities  Areas are populated with people going about their business and their day  You really get the sense that the denizens have lives  Youll even hear them speaking a few times or mumbling to themselves  And the way Altair interacts with them is quite fascinating as well  As you run for instance hell push people out of the way  If youre walking hell gently brush past them  The animations are smooth much of the time even when scaling walls  Theres a lot of meticulous detail here  Its just a shame that from time to time the game buckles under its own weight  There will be times when the frame rate will dip and there will be some performance issues  There were also moments of clipping although in my experience they were few and far betweenWhat save Assassins Creed from many of its faults is that the narrative and story is very good  Despite how repetitive it can be youll often find yourself wanting to go further down the rabbit hole to unravel more of the plot because that actually is pretty interesting in and of itself,4.0,An Interesting Story Saves it From Some Repetitive Gameplay,1356048000,"12 21, 2012",3

Ninja Gaiden 2 but Ninja Gaiden Black along with Sigma 1 and Sigma 2  Im also someone who is a huge enthusiast for this gaming subgenrea  I have Devil May Cry 14 Bayonetta Castlevania Lords of Shadow God of War 13 Ninja Blade Dantes Inferno and a host of others  Ive experience some of the best all the way to the mediocre  Im not a guru by any means but still an enthusiast  The thing is Itagaki and the REAL Team Ninja arent there anymore  He and all the leads left because of that fiasco at Tecmo Love Itagaki or hate him he really knows how to make these games awesome  But Im not here to discuss my opinion on difference on the development teamsI must say that Im very disappointed with this entry in the series  Ive always regarded the original Ninja Gaiden and Ninja Gaiden 2 as the gold standard for this type of game  Im just quickly getting out the minor details out of the way  While technically Im not super impressed its not the reason why Im really disgusted with this entry  The graphics and sounds are fine  Not amazing but not really too bad to the point that its hard to look at  Another part of the presentation is the story which doesnt really impress me either but old or new Team Ninja story was never their strong point  It was there to give the game structure but not be a majory selling pointMy primary gripe honestly resolved around the changes in the gameplay which is what made the first 2 entries in the series great  People always complained about the camera but it was a minor problem at the most  What gets me though is the horrible level design  The previous games have large areas where there are some things to wall run along and do other stunts while also having plenty of room to deal out death  This new game it seems to like to put the player in a small to medium sized pen where guys come from behind obstacles like crashed cars until it feels youre ready to move on  Theres no flow of combat with the area  No long hallways or large ballrooms or temple courtyards to flip or wallrun through  Its just a one level small pen  Which not much room to maneuver to be able to do your movesThe gameplay also feel sluggish and unresponsive  I found too many times that I was trying to turn Ryu or get him to flip out of a group of enemies or use specific combinations but it seems to not respond properly  There were times that I wanted him to fight a specific target and he wanted to look at someone else which would lead me to actually get hit  Even when I could gaet him to do what I want it was slow and just didnt seem responsive  But that doeasnt matter because honestly this game is super easy even when its not the hero mode the new developers talked about so much  In the previous games if you button mashed you learned that hardway and died  This game you just get a gentle smack  Theres no reward or satisfaction to doing something difficult because its handed to you  The flow of combat seems off too  In the 1st Ninja Gaiden  It was focused on a target with a small of other other guys to go after  You almost had this nice way of focusing on a target yet can untangle then group or go after his friend  Ninja Gaiden 2 really improved it too where there was a fluid motion of engaging an enemy and finishing him then moving onto the next enemy withing a large group of enemies  It felt almost as though you could chain the fight into one large string of combos if you timed it well enough  Here it seems messy  Fights are somewhat chaotic but not in a good way  It was as though the 3rd game took both battle elements of the previous two games but made a mess of it  Nothing seemed to work right  Along with the sluggish controls engagements just dont seem to have good pacing to do combos or to switch targets  The handling and gameplay elements just seem off to me compared to other games in thie genre and even in this seriesNow Quick Time Events or QTE  I always hated these in God of War  I feel that they are a lazy way for developers to do over the top sequences without really making it part of the gameplay  I do find them done some ways where its tasteful but for action games I feel they are more detracting that fun  Games like Bayonetta and the new Castlevania overall kept these to a minimum which is what I like  I just dont find it fun doing a DDR rhythm game when I should be setting up combos to own a group of enemies  Theyre more there to distract the casual ADD gamer more than anything I thinkA couple of other things I want to go through would be the lame gameplay gimmicks like the kunai climbing which is not only boring but doesnt seem to really have been done well at all  But maybe they wanted to distract us from the monotony  Another is the lack of decapitations  Personally its not just gore for gores sake but more along the lines of gore that looks awesome because of the very nature of what ninja combat is  Its an great viseral aestetic of the nature of the gameI could go on about other things but I think the bulk of what a longtime hardcore Ninja Gaiden fan like myself needed to say was said and frankly I dont want to write a whole essay on this  There are others who elaborate about why we feel this game was a bit insulting to the fans of the series  We laments the disappointment that this latest entry is and in some ways I want to dream that Itagaki and the real Team Ninja would come back to save this beloved franchise one day,1.0,A huge disappointment for such a great series,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",3

A27OW0P38B28OP,B000084318,T Hill Relytia,"[3, 3]",The Wind Waker is a very interesting game to say the least When in development never had another Zelda game garnered such polarized reactions from anticipating fans with regards to their reaction to WWs artistic style Once gamers got their hands on this gem however all fears of Zelda going astray and becoming childish were quickly dispelled and we were treated to one special game You know one could argue that The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is the greatest Zelda game of all time You could also argue that Twilight Princess is the best most refined Zelda game of all time I actually agree with both of these statements Despite that though Wind Waker is still my personal favorite Zelda game and one that I have an absolutely incredible amount of nostalgia for It truly is a special gameThe most noticeable and immediately striking aspect of Wind Waker is undoubtedly its graphics Despite initial cynicism most people came to embrace this aspect of the game and view it as one of its strongest aspects The cel shaded graphics on display here are spectacularly vibrant and seem to really pop off the screen as if you were actually looking through a window into a 3D space Another great benefit of this graphical style is that it really lends itself to emotional impactful storytelling In fact I find that Wind Wakers characters convey emotion and thoughts better than 95 of games released now despite how many are using advanced technology like motion capture these days This really adds to the impact and emotional strength of Wind Wakers already moving epic storyThe art design really compliments this cel shaded graphical style well The places you go the people you encounter all of it screams classic nostalgic Zelda while taking you to places of well not EXACTLY Hyrule but sort of that you wont expect From going into flaming volcanoes to inside an island held entirely in a magical vast hallowedout tree trunk this is one heck of a visual adventure Sailing across a vast ocean never looked so good The music cannot go unmentioned either You will hear classic Legend of Zelda themes and motifs in the music but also new music that really fits in with that classical Zelda vibe while striking a decidedly more colorful tone on its own The sound design is of equal caliber as well and really add to the atmosphere of every environment you visitSeeing how this IS a Zelda game you can pretty much guess the premise of the story Its set in a world where the ocean covers most of the landscape pockmarked by islands big and small On one particular island it is customary for boys of a certain age to dress as the legendary Hero of Time from the nowfairytale folklore people tellthe same story that gamers played in Ocarina of Time in order to instill and emulate in the boy the same courage as that legendary Hero of Time Well its one boys birthday but his wearing the Heros tunic is more than customary as he is about to become his own fabled hero His sister is kidnapped by a giant evil bird and he goes out to save herThats the initial premise of the story Its not entirely derivative of the princess in distress tale were used to and by the end of this epic tale Link will have joined pirates become the next Hero approved by the Gods go through dungeons for ancient powerful artifacts to save the day meet familiar characters and have one heckuva climatic ending sequence To think thats just a taste of where the story will take you I have to admit when I first went into WW I expected amazing gameplay gorgeous sound and art design and a merely decent acceptable story but boy was I in for a surprise The story here is exceptionally deep even surprisingly dark at times and that is right up my alley I absolutely love the story in Wind Waker and it may very well be my favorite aspect It definitely isnt kiddy in any sense of the word Its as adult as any of Links adventures have ever been I really dont want to give away any specific details but suffice to say I picked my jaw off the floor and even held back a tear here and there more than once throughout the entire tale Its truly specialThe gameplay is as you would expect from a Zelda game meaning refined near perfection The basic format is here Explore a large open world find important areas and meet important people go on sidequests enter crucial temples go through dungeons with its various clever puzzles and new gadgets imperative to succeed and fight epic boss battles The only thing different here is that instead of traversing dry land on epona you traverse vast oceanic spaces on The Red King of Lions Because the overworld is an ocean this really does feel like the biggest Zelda game space ever even in retrospectSome find the sailing parts to be boring but not me I find them very relaxing and enjoyable to take in the game world Radiant sunrises beautiful sunsets and storms on the open seas is a sight to behold and its scenes like this during the sailing sequences that really add to the atmotsphere of the story There are less Temples in Wind Waker than other Zelda games and is a bit shorter as a result It also seems to be a bit easier than other titles in this franchise but none of these issues lessen the value of the experience in any way This is as good as Zelda gameplay gets In fact there is a substantial amount of swordplay improvement here over its predecessors and that really adds to the feeling of being a legendary swordsman hero Amazing stuffI know that Im missing some of the more minor details here but Im sure you get the idea I could write twice this much times three about this amazing gemstone in Nintedos gaming library As a matter of fact I have played this game at least once each year since I bought it 2005 and it never gets old or shows any signs of age whatsoever Its a timeless classic and a mustplay for anyone who loves Zelda adventures with fantastic stories This game feels like a prettier more stylistic Ocarina of Time It has an incredibly epic story a beautiful imaginationfueled design and gameplay bordering on perfection It really is that good Buy it sail through its majesty and become a new hero worthy of legend,5.0,A truly magical beautifully unique entry in the legendary Zelda series,1315267200,"09 6, 2011",3

A1UH8M9QALD2LS,B001G9F9KA,MS,"[16, 17]",STORYYou begin the game as Atsuki Saijo a young member of the group named FORT and the person in charge of rooting out an infection called Silent Hes traveled to the town of Kisaragi in order to track down the perpetrator of several crimes as well as a notorious Silent infectee While investigating Atsuki has to pose as a normal high school student and glean information from his peers The story while sounding simple enough at first becomes more confusing and difficult to wade through as time goes on It doesnt help that the game comes with multiple endings meaning if you want the full picture youre going to have to play through it multiple times The plot isnt what I would call bad but it certainly tries to mash too many themes together The tone of the story seemed to be a horror storymystery at the start but it quickly changed to one of high school fluff and drama The mixture didnt sit very well with me especially since you could find yourself looking at a suicide one minute and then discussing cakes the nextGAMEPLAYAs its known as a visual novel the gameplay in LuxPain mainly consists of sifting through mountains of text while running around town talking to different people The game tries to give you the illusion that youre free to go where you want after school but thats really all it is an illusion There are always certain places where you wont be able to go And really theres almost no strategy involved in searching the town All you have to do is check the available areas before hitting the hay at Atsukis house LuxPain really holds your hand throughout the entire course of the game and rarely lets you have control of your own actions Its certainly possible to choose which order you want to do things in but it almost never makes a difference At school and around town youll often find people to talk to and theyll just rattle off strings of dialogue while you stand around saying nothing There are a few times here and there when youll get to navigate a bland and uninteresting dialogue tree but other than that Atsuki is completely quiet Its nice that there were so many people around town to talk to but I often got the feeling that they were talking at me not with me A little more freedom of choice would have helped the game a whole lot You can never really choose anything to say or do in fact the mystery basically solves itself for youOccasionally when talking with people Atsuki will notice a worm inside someone and begin using Sigma to detect it Its a bit like a simple minigame all you have to do is scratch away at the screen and then hold the stylus over the worm until its gone Theres really not much skill involved with it Once thats done a term will appear The term is generally just a few words which will appear to have almost no meaning at first Sometimes the terms are relevant to the mystery but sometimes theyre completely inane At the start of the game I was impressed with the way the thoughts of the killer and his victims  presented themselves there was a sense of disjointedness and above all tension and fear But the majority of other peoples thoughts are a good deal less impressive I remember that near the start of the game I had to scan Rui Yamase and tap on a worm The term showed up and her thoughts were abouthow much she liked her school It was quite simply useless information Ruis love of school was never vital information and it didnt provide me with any real insight into anything either That wasnt the only time it happened There were several other occasions where the thoughts of the person had nothing to do with the investigation at all Sometimes phrases are mentioned and then never brought up again Every now and again youll encounter a larger Silent inside of someone and then you have to go through LuxPains equivalent of a  boss battle These sequences are rarely anything more challenging than simply tapping on the touch screen though Theres almost no other interactivity with the touch screen except for the moments when you have to scribble madly at the screen in order to uncover a worm Most of the time due to the enormous amounts of  text youll simply be mashing the a button like your life depends on itOne of the many things that rubbed me the wrong way about LuxPain was the fact that I constantly had to refer back to the manual to remind myself what was going on At the beginning of the story the game simply dumps you into the overworld map without so much as a vague explanation of the menu system This lack of a tutorial can actually severely affect gameplay Case in point certain events are limitedtimeonly and expire if you dont see to them right away Natsuki one of Atsukis allies from FORT has a very useful scanning ability which lets you know how much time you have to witness the event before its lost forever Unfortunately the game neglects to inform you of this In fact I didnt even realize that events had time limits until I missed one or two of them Missing important cutscenes means that you will most likely not get the best ending on your first playthrough  Theres an incredible amount of information that the game simply doesnt tell you Instead youll have to pick up your manual  assuming you still own it and read through it just to figure out what in the blue blazes youre supposed to be doingThats the majority of LuxPains gameplay in a nutshell Visit places at school and around town talk to people listen to their inane psychobabble repeat Its not bad its just boring Half the time youll have no idea what your peers or fellow townsfolk are talking or thinking about and trying to shovel through massive clots of pointless dialogue only makes the problem worseVISUALS CHARACTERS AUDIO AND WRITINGLuxPain is a visual novel and as such usually consists of simple static images on an unmoving background Character sprites usually have a few different emotions all of which look decent and get the point across Its a slicklooking game and will most likely appeal to an audience who enjoys anime and manga it closely resembles some of the more recent Persona games in case a frame of reference is needed There are quite a few different characters and animations packed into the game which is something Ill praise LuxPain for The music was decent but nothing struck me as being particularly memorable It was standard fare and served mainly as background noise to whatever else was going onAs mentioned before there are tons of characters in LuxPain Really there are Youll encounter a variety of people from day to day some of which may end up being key parts of your investigation The game manages to flesh out most of your schoolmates fairly well But theres one glaringly obvious problem that rubbed me the wrong way I didnt connect at all with Atsuki Lets sum things upAtsuki an orphan whose parents and sister were killed Hes supposedly quite attractive but he broods a lot and rarely says anything throughout the course of the game He shows little emotion or reaction to anything his friends do or say How many of these heroes have I seen before His type is a dimeadozen Its not as though I like or disliked him its as though he just never bothered to show up on the day when they were handing out personalitiesMy final and possibly most infuriating problem with LuxPain is the translation and localization issues To put it frankly the game is absolutely filled with grammar punctuation and spelling errors This is a textbased game in which virtually all you do is read They have no excuse for screwing it up Sometimes I found myself getting lost in the midst of conversations because the way the characters talked was so obtuse and irregular The dialogue is by no means unintelligible but its very distracting to try and pay attention to a serious scene when my eye keeps getting stuck on missing punctuation marks Sometimes usually during more important scenes a voiceover will begin The voice acting is quite good I have no complaints with it So whats the matter The text and the voice sometimes dont match Its confusing frustrating and above all it makes you wonder who proofread this game It really should have been cleaned up more before being released to the consumers If you are a stickler for proper grammar and spelling bewareCONCLUSIONLuxPain could have been a great game The concept of exploring a town hunting down a supernatural mental virus and uncovering a sinister plot sounds awesome Unfortunately it didnt live up to my expectations The lack of tutorials repetitive nature of gameplay convoluted story and flawed dialogue will drive many gamers into either a state of severe boredom or a one of teethgnashing insanity Although I had a decent time with it I cant really recommend itThe whole thing left a rather bad taste in my mouth because it could have been great only it wasnt,3.0,A Good Idea but Problems Abound,1256169600,"10 22,

A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,B00004SVS7,Mike London MAC,"[6, 9]",By the time Capcom released MEGA MAN VI on the NES it was obvious to all in the industry that Nintendos 8Bit console the machine that resurrected the video game market in the mid 1980s to the multibillion dollar industry that it is now was on its last legs  Capcom wanted to move Mega Man to the SNES but before doing so they made a final chapter for everyones favorite blue bomberIronically enough Capcom chose not to release MEGA MAN VI in the United States publishing the game only in Japan due to their decision to put their efforts behind the new MEGA MAN X series  When Capcom informed Nintendo of this decision Nintendo took it upon themselves to publish the game in America which is why the game was never released in EuropeHow does it stand up to the other five games  Actually not that bad  Its obvious Capcom is running out of ideas  The basic story is that a mysterious Mr X gee I wonder who that could be has been setting up a robot tournament and when Mega Man shows up all the robots turn against Mega Man and Mr X tries to take over the world  Naturally when you defeat Mr X turns out it is Dr Wiley and you have to go into a second castle  While Mega Man IV and V at least at an element of surprise in their twist ending by VI you can tell its Wiley from the beginning even kinda looks like himFirst off the graphics are top notch and so is the sound  But that is little surprise as Mega Man always had great graphics for the NESCapcom was so bereft of ideas They even had contestant winners in Nintendo Power design two of the robot bosses Wind Man designed by Michael Leader of the US and Knight Man designed by Daniel Vallie of CanadaThe other six bosses are largely retreads of previous robot masters or just plain ridiculousWe have Plant Man who might I add is the single worst boss in not only Mega Man but in all of video games  hes just gay  His lame weapon is a flower shield and basically hes a poor boy version of the superior Leaf Man from MEGA MAN II  We have Blizzard Man who for whatever reason is on skis  Ripoff of Air Man from II and Ice Man from the first game  Flame Man is yet another heatbased robot master weve already had Fire Man from I Heat Man from II and Napalm Man from V  We have Tomahawk Man who is very formidable but still feels out of place and like Capcom was really stretching for ideas  Centaur Man is at least somewhat imaginative The worst though is Yamato Man  Apparently Yamato is a geographical term in Japan  Itd be like Oxford Man or Birmingshire Man or Las Vegas Man  Incomprehensible  Stupid  Even Wind Man who was designed by one of the contestant winners is little more than another version of Air ManThe levels themselves while compentant are hardly what you call inspired  A lot of them you have seen before in previous incarnations especially Flame Mans level come on weve had firethemed levels beforeA bad part of the levels is that four of them have false endings I guess in attempts from Capcom to give the game more replayability In each of the levels for Tomahawk Man Yamato Man Knight Man and Centaur Man two separate boss chambers appear one more difficult to reach than the other  By accessing the more difficult of the two you get one of four letters B E A T and when you get all four you can now use Beat the robotic bird from Mega Man V  Quite frankly the fake endings are rather dumbThe last levels have some engaging moments even though one of the castle bosses a big dragon is a little too similar too the boss dragon of Mega Man II for my comfort  Theres another stage in the Wileys castle which is primarily dirty water and those spiked orbs which is again a throw back to Mega Man IIThe end features Dr Wiley being thrown in jail with the last words and a newspaper picture printed  The ending provides good closure for the series but then Capcom spoils that by saying To be continued  Still a good way to close the NES leg of Mega Mans journey as far as storywise goesMega Man also has some new features  Taking a page from Mario he has a rush adapter that allows him to fly albeit pretty briefly  This is featured prominently on the game art  Beat returns  I would like to have flown longer given how much this was hypedIs MEGA MAN VI a good game Yes  Without a doubt  It would be an even better game its five predecessors did not exist  Because ultimately even though they tried adding some new things to the Mega Man formula at the end of the day Capcom with this title feels tired and uninspired like they trying to squeeze one more dollar out of the Mega Man franchise  But thats largely because MEGA MAN VI is just more of the same  If you like the formula youll love this title  But it is still very formulaicAll the NES Mega Man games are good but theyre largely the same  Id go with II or III first but if you havent played any Mega Man games VI is a good place to start  But II and III should be your first

A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B00ENFVUGQ,Strategos The Guardian of Time,"[1, 2]",I hesitated to play XCOM Enemy Unknown While Im a HUGE fan of Alpha Centauri and the Alien Crossfire expansion I havent liked a Civilization game since Civ II And the game that it was based on the original XCOM was just too complex for me to get into Nevertheless one day I decided to give it a try after being told about how great it was by a coworker And try it I didXCOMEnemy Unknown was for me equal parts amazement and frustration As everyone who has played it knows its a hard game A VERY hard game So hard in fact that I completely lost the game on my first playthrough on EASY My pride was severely wounded to say nothing of my squad members but I decided to try it again and on the second playthrough I was able to beat the game I found the gameplay to be amazingly fun but hard hard hard Oh yeah and XCOMEnemy Unknown in the Windows PC version has HORRIBLE bugs Im talking gamebreaking bugs As in spending hours playing to have it suddenly freeze the entire PC As in running Windows updates and then finding that the game wont launch at all As in freezing for seconds at a time every few minutes and locking up my PC completely ON THE FINAL LEVEL I was eventually able to beat the game by saving often in the middle of battles rebooting frequently and uninstalling HUNDREDS of patches on my computer and removing every program except the bare essentials needed to boot and use my PC But good grief The game is good butit left me wishing I had gotten the console versionFast forward to the end of this year when my best bro bought me a copy of this expansion what a great guy After having played the game through to completion I have concluded that anyone interested should skip Enemy Unknown entirely for their first playthrough and then go back to the original if they want to try a more steamlined experience My reasonsBug FixesPraise the Lord of Gaming The horrible gamebreaking bugs that plagued Enemy Unknown have been fixed in this expansion The freezing in battles is gone The game launch failures are gone The complete system lockups are gone And yes I was even able to complete the final mission in a single sitting without my computer crashing Woohoo Now I havent tried playing the Original Enemy Unknown since getting Enemy Within yet so I cant say whether the fixes affect both I may never know becauseRebalanced GameplayYeah yeah People have gone on and on about how the original Enemy Unknown was balanced like a fine violin playing while you sipped your fine wine and ate your fine cheese with your fine girlfriend But I am here to burst your bubble and tell you that Enemy Unknown had some aspects that were REALLY unbalanced For starters Assault class soldiers were almost impossible to keep alive They did mucho damage but since they have fewer hitpoints and are best at close range I watched ALL of them get massacred Likewise heavies had such poor aim that they were pretty much useless So like most people I just ended up making a squad of mostly snipers and medics This my friends is not balance Enemy Within fixes thisQuite simply the addition of MELD forces you to 1 Come out of hiding and go after objectives making the offensivedefensive more balanced and 2 Use additional capabilities to balance the deficiencies in your soldiersInvisible psychic mutantsEnemy Unknown had special types of armor but their perks were so low compared to their negatives that you wouldnt be blamed for just sticking with plainjane weapons and armor that simply did the most damage All that changes with MELD though Because NOW your Assault class can literally be the most powerful units in the game I know this because my bluehaired German woman had genetic cloaking autofire on near enemies double attack and so many defensive stat boosts that yes she was pretty much IMPOSSIBLE to kill Ah nothing like a double shotgun to the servos of a mech by a woman who fires a cannon at point blank range and was two feet away because she was invisible And of course if that doesnt work shell fry youWITH HER MIND Mwahaahaaa Ahem At any rate when you have medics that cant be poisoned or strangled Heavies with super vision and invisible Assault troops that special armor and weapons youve been throwing away and all the lovely new additions to this game go from being useless to useful tradeoffs giving cloaking armor to your medic who cant be poisoned or flight gear to your supereagleeyed sniper suddenly makes a lot more sense This WOULD unbalance the game if it werent for all the new soupedup enemies tromping around in mech suits and strangling you like smaller versions of squidies from the Matrix But thats okay becauseSuper Robot WarsThe mech suits COMPLETELY change things up in this expansion Because they cannot hide they are good for charging into battle Because they can heal multiple units they encourage you to be more wreckless in your charges And because they can do DEVESTATING closerange damage to a single unit or cause panicdeath in an entire group they arejust plain FUN Seriously who DOESNT want to run around in a giant robot suit smashing and blasting aliens Isnt that every boys dreamThe more things changeThere are more maps to play on More missions An entire subplot with an enemy organization A frantic battle to defend the base against an alien attack More types of grenades more languages spoken medals to pin on your best troops genetic modifications robot suits of armor but the main game and the primary gameplay have not changed If you didnt like Enemy Unknown this game wont convert you There arent underwater missions or sky missions or space missions Youre not going to fly Skyrangers or have any other new types of gameplay But the additions here are enough that this is definitely version 15 of XCOM and there is very little reason to go back in my opinion I can do without most of the other changes people might have asked for but one just irritate me a bit I would love a branch storyline with different endings or at the very least a better one than we got in Enemy Unknown That said the journey is still very much worth taking And this game is even more fun that it was before Couple that with the miraculous bug fixes and we have a winner for everyone who enjoyed the first game and a great entry point for everyone who hasnt given it

A3AQJOBOI60CVJ,B002BSC4ZS,Felllix,"[2, 4]",Metroid Other M is a hard game to review for a lot of reasons First it takes a beloved franchise and removes many of the elements that made it great It also features a previously mute character become a poorlywritten horriblyacted wuss in the face of the same dangers shes faced before In many ways its a step back for the Metroid franchise after the excellent Prime gamesI guess since everyone else does I need to talk about the story first Metroid Other Ms story is an abomination Its script is one of the worst ever written It contains moments that make no sense in or out of the games context Its twists are obvious and handled poorly Points made hours ago are repeated endlessly A murder mystery plot is brought up and left completely unresolved Many have pointed out the fact that Samus Aran previously an amazingly competent female bounty hunter is now reduced to a simpering mother figure who must be subservient to a man who doesnt outrank her Theres something to that and yeah its amazingly sexist even apart from how clunkily its handled but Im more concerned about what it does to the feel of the gamePrevious Metroid games were all based on exploration They contained labyrinthine worlds and the gameplay was based around the gradual widening of those worlds once new weapons and tools became available They became series of revelations that built upon one another culminating in boss battles and discoveries This feeling of accomplishment is here replaced with the arbitrary edict of a bureaucrat that Samus doesnt even work for And the implementation stinks for some reason this guy cant be bothered to authorize the Varia suit the second Samus steps into an environment that hurts her no he needs to wait awhile while this independent woman suffers for no reason at all Beyond that an explanation is given as to why certain types of weapons cant be used which makes a certain amount of sense but what possible reason could there be to not authorize the use of a suit that does nothing but protect its wearer What about the grapple beam which isnt a weapon at all or the speed booster This is never really explained because theres no way it could be made to make senseThe gameplay of Other M is better than its story though still containing many odd decisions One of the strangest is the ability to scan some objects but not others the game constantly contains things that look like they should be useful but arent This is a departure from the Prime series in which nearly everything could be scanned for useful information and worldbuilding Thats all gone here in favor of being able to scan objects that can be blown up and very occasionally storyrelevant objects The game also contains annoying sections in which it shifts to firstperson until you scan the correct thing which isnt labeled More than once I had to spin around until something looked interestingThe core gameplay is similar to a 25d version of Super Metroid with less exploration This is by far the most linear Metroid game and I think thats a mistake in a series known for its explorationbased gameplay The decision to use the Wiis Dpad instead of the nunchuks analog stick leads to some imprecision though one gets the impression that the game was designed with this in mind so problems with it rarely come up In addition the decision to wrest the decision of when to use missiles away from the player leads to some very frustrating moments The elimination of powerups is an odd omission as well instead of getting them simply hold the Wiimote upwards and hold A until your missiles refill or when youre low on health until a bar fills restoring some of it One could argue this was done to avoid the problem of collecting powerups in a pseudo 3D environment but the original Prime solved this problem in 2002 by letting the charge beam attract the power ups I dont understand why this couldnt have been done here tooBUT and this is a big but one cant really blame Nintendo or Team Ninja for refusing to simply make another entry in the Prime series As someone who preferred the control scheme of the Gamecube controller to that of Metroid Prime 3s imprecise aiming mechanisms I can see why someone would want to move away from it While the game on the whole may be a mistake it at least took some chances with the formula of Metroid in an attempt to streamline it instead of just adding features Nintendo has been playing it safe for so long with some many of its franchise its kind of nice to see them take a chance with a major label The chance doesnt pay off as well as it should have but hey this is how progress gets madeThe compliments I can give Other M are actually kind of numerous Despite the control problems the team made them work pretty well for the boss battles which are often pretty spectacular The fight with Ridley despite immediately following one of the games most insulting moments is one of the best encounters with him in any of the games comparable I think to the encounter at the end of the first Prime The games functional final bosses are both great as well if a little short The games difficulty curve is about deadon for these too I think the final boss may actually be the most difficult to killThe game benefits from extremely brisk pacing as well Just when I thought I was about to get sick of the game for stagnating it introduced a new weapon or an interesting section which kept things fresh throughout Or to put it another way if Metroid Prime was this series Jurassic Park this is its Jurassic Park 3 Dumber more actionoriented but briskly getting the job done The fact that I finished the game in about 8 hours is actually a point in its favor it comes in does what it needs to do and gets out before one can really get too tired of it Think of it as the 90minute franchise threequel that doesnt compare to the original but is entertaining nonetheless and I think your expectations will be set about rightThe game looks just fine and sounds just fine too The music isnt too memorable and the woman voicing Samus is just awful but the rest of it is functional on an aesthetic level I would have like a couple of tracks that paid tribute to classic Metroid tunes but above I criticized Nintendo for stagnating so whatever Im loathe to criticize a Wii games graphics why beat a dead horse but theres nothing wrong hereDoes that spell a recommendation Just barely and only for the price currently listed on Amazon I got it for 10 If you cant get past the sexism I cant say it bothers me too much compared to the storytelling fumbles then by all means stay away youll be fully justified But take Metroid Other M for what it is a dumb action game Maybe later well be able to write off the story as noncanon too,3.0,You could certainly do worse,1339200000,"06 9, 2012",3
A2BZ4HSRBB5V6A,B002I0J5UQ,Michael,"[12, 23]",LA Noire has got to be the most overrated overhyped game of 2011  Its an utter disappointment in every wayOkay so the graphics are pretty impressive  But the world is basically a lifeless interactiveless pit of nothing to do  So much was written about solving crimes and bagging the bad guys but the system is utter crap and solving crimes effectively means walking around a crime scene pressing A on everything waiting to see whether your in game character will deduce a clue out of it or call the player an idiot for even entertaining the idea  Early in the game there is a crime where you find a matchbook of some bar and its a critical piece of evidence pointing you to the last place a character was in before a crime was committed But then in dozens of other crime scenes you find matchbooks all over the place and Cole Phelps  the overreacting buffoon that he is  tells you that its irrelevant  You figure out pretty quickly that there are three clues for every crime scene and basically nothing else is important  Its all contrived garbageThe Lie Truth and oh whats the third one hunch or something system is a mystery to me  Youre given a system where characters tell you stories and youre supposed to suspect that theyre lying telling the truth or maybe theyre being honest but just dropping a few elements but your characters response to your choices are completely disconnected  Lie basically means to accuse them of murder using this firery over the top rhetoric that left me sitting there EVERY TIME and saying NO NO Obviously the GRANDMOTHER didnt do it but shes not telling the truth you idiot  Needless to say Cole Phelps investigator extraordinair accuses her of murdering her husband or something and then youre pretty much guaranteed to get a stern talking to from the chiefWhich moves me to my next point  The game plods along basically with no input from the user  Nothing the player does matters  The crimes will all be solved its just a measure of whether you solve them all correctly or if you miss a few elements of evidence  You basically have no idea of whether you solved it correctly or not other than that the boss tells you that youve been demoted to cleaning up parks for a few months and youre taken off the beat  but even that doesnt happen  Your chief rips you a new hole tells you youre the worst cop ever in the history of Los Angeles and then  after a loading screen youre onto the next makeorbreak crime of the century caperThe driving is stuffy and crummy although I think that the navigation system is clever  Basically youre always riding with some other idiot caricature of a cop and he tells you where to go  I think its pretty well doneThe overarching story line about your character is boring and takes too long and you can pretty much figure it out through the first cut scene  And you really just dont care about Cole enough to give a hoot about his times during the warOther overhyped components  The graphics are good and the facial animations are advanced but give the rest of the game a cartoonish feel  The polycounts and animation detail in the faces makes their lifeless bodies appear like marionettes acting out dramatic scenes  The run and gun gameplay is out of place its taken from GTA or Red Dead Redemption but it just feels wrong in this game and the hand to hand sequences are also stupid  You can expect one thrilling hand to hand fight in each crime and basically you mash a few buttons policebrutality some criminal thugs and then they tell you whodunit  The most overrated addition to the game though is this lame lie  truth facial animation thing  I read in interviews that some schools were using the game to help kids who had Autism or Aspbergers be able to figure out expressions on people  Oh god I groaned those poor kids  I consider myself a pretty strong conversationalist I get along well with people work well with colleagues have steady relationships and I have strong people skills to the best of my knowledge I do not have debilitating issues with socializing  Yet this game was utterly perplexing to me  There are a few cases where yeah obviously theyre lying  theyre scratching themselves or their eyes are darting all over a room but then there are scores more where characters are giving you positively perplexing looks and I suppose thats supposed to mean theyre  telling the truth  Like they stare at you with this bizarre look on their face  Now if my girlfriend or one of my coworkers was telling me a story and then stared at me afterwards and interjected bizarre oneliners while I tried to think up the right response SELECTS LIE YOU MURDERER YOU KILLED YOUR KITTEN AND THEN YOU STUFFED THE BODY INTO THE SINK AND YOU THOUGHT ID NEVER FIND OUT YOU DUMB IDIOT YOURE BEING THROWN IN PRISON WITH THE REST OF THE SODOMITES AND CAT KILLERS  Cole Phelps 2011 then frankly Id probably suspect that _they_ were murderersAnywayLA Noire is overhyped garbage  It has the underpinnings of what could have been a solid game  an accurately laid out city nice period setting intriguing style of play and more  but it dropped the ball in every area  I was so excited for LA Noire being an absolute sucker for anything period  especially Noire films and crime drama  and I was just utterly unimpressed left with my

AHFCR62NWJ3LE,B005XOJ6NK,Putts,"[7, 9]",I never had a Sega Genesis growing up but that didnt stop me from going over to my friends houses and playing the fantastic Sonic the Hedgehog series on theirs  For that reason I have very fond memories of Sonics first 4 console outings from Sonic the Hedgehog up through Sonic  Knuckles lets just pretend that 3D Blast didnt exist  Unfortunately Sonic and I parted ways for quite some time after that barring a brief stint with Sonic Heroes on my GameCube and Sonic Rush on my DS as well as the aforementioned classics as part of one of those Sonic collections games  But I certainly havent been unaware of the significant decline in quality of Sonic games over the last decade or so  So when I heard that Sonic Generations was one of the best Sonic titles to come along in years one that paid tribute to the classics that we all know and love I knew that this was one game Id need to check out  Sadly I discovered that one of the best Sonic titles to come along in years apparently doesnt count for muchSonic Generations started off extremely strongly for me aside from some annoying cutscenes and a poor attempt at giving this game some sort of plot  The game featured remakes of some of the most memorable zones from the Genesis classics including Green Hill Zone from the original Chemical Plant from Sonic 2 and Sky Sanctuary from Sonic  Knuckles  Each level in the game featured 2 acts the first being a classic version thats completely side scrolling but still uses some impressive 3D effects from time to time and the other being a modern version that uses the 3D version of Sonic shifting seamlessly from 2D to 3D play  Playing both acts in all 3 of those zones was a lot of fun and for a second I thought that I was missing out on some genuinely great games by skipping most of the 3D Sonic library  Unfortunately as the game progressed that attitude quickly changed  As the game progressed the quality in level design declined with the final zone Planet Wisp being so completely awful that I refuse to play it anymore  The later levels are also rather repetitive with 4 of the 9 zones in the game featuring citybased levels  Was that really necessary  Sonic games have featured so many awesome fantasylike environments yet they give us 4 urban ones  The boss fights are equally bad with the second to last boss being completely buggy everything from bad hit detection to broken controls to a lockon targeting mechanism that only works half the time and the final boss so poorly designed and unenjoyable that I had a hard time believing that I was still playing a Sonic gameThere seem to be an alarming number of bugs in this game for something thats been out for 2 months  Ive had the game crash twice on me so far and countless issues with controls not working when they should particularly with the jump button button and its lockon function for 3D Sonic  Yet despite these problems I finished the game in 4 hours  There is a lot of challenge content to tackle afterward but a lot of these are just speed runs or lousy gimmicks tacked onto part of or all of a level  For completionists this might bump up the playtime significantly but if you just want to play the game and see most of the content that the game has to offer you wont be here longThat having been said the game is not without its merits  The graphics and the music are fantastic the former offering amazing views of the games massive levels with a buttery smooth framerate if your computer can handle it and the latter featuring some memorable remixes and original versions of the librarys best musical offerings  There is plenty of artmusicvideo content to unlock for the nostalgic  A lot of levels offer a great sense of speed and exploration that reward the persistent player despite a few levels falling completely flatHonestly if Sega had managed to make the entire game as good as the first 13 of the game I would have given it 5 stars in a heartbeat  Everybody remembers Sonic for the Genesisera classics  There is very little beyond that that is worth celebrating and paying tribute to in a future title,3.0,A game that starts off strong but quickly fizzles out,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",3

A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B006ZPAYD2,James Donnelly Ave Atque Vale,"[2, 2]",When I got my first Legobased game the original STAR WARS game I fell in love with the series It was so simple but done with such excellent and incredibly fun execution that you couldnt help but fall in love with it It was a game that would appeal to children easily and perhaps adults even more easily recreating your favorite scenes of the films This followed suit with the Lego INDIANA JONES TRILOGY Not the Complete Adventures because I still wanted nothing to do with CRYSTAL SKULL When the first LEGO BATMAN came out I was ecstatic and I played it until my fingers were ready to fall off My favorite comic character of all time had a Lego game It was probably my favorite of the Lego series that I had playedUntil LEGO BATMAN 2 DC SUPER HEROES came out that isI have been playing this game with a greater fervor than any of the previous games combined The biggest plus for me regarding this game is the much more open worldness of the game It feels like a much bigger game and it certainly is in regards to character story and graphics The main story is very much like the older and sillier teamup comic books in which the best villains combine forces to wreak havoc on their respective heroes which is what brings together Batman Robin and Superman vs The Joker and Lex Luthor Of course all of the inmates of Arkham escape as well so youre up against many of the villains of the first game as well such as TwoFace Harley Quinn The Penguin Catwoman etc But this isnt just those three characters as the heroes As you go deeper into the story gameplay you get the most of the current lineup of the Justice League Wonder Woman Green Lantern The Flash and CyborgYou still have the constant pumping of Danny Elfmans iconic score from the 1989 Batman film but nicely when youre in the open world scenarios if you choose to fly with Superman you get the even more iconic John Williams Superman theme As far as sound design is concerned this is the first time that youre treated to actual dialogue in a Lego game and again the dialogue is aimed at kids but for an allages game the dialogue fits these characters very well and particularly the newscasts during the cutscenes are very clever with the scroll at the bottom of the screen which is something the adults will get a big kick out of The sound effects are terrific and you even have Clancy Brown returning to voice Lex Luthor as he did in the SUPERMAN and JUSTICE LEAGUE animated series Sadly no Mark Hamill Kevin Conroy or Tim Daly thoughThe biggest attraction for me personally was the amazing list of unlockable characters Characters like Aquaman Hush Ras al Ghul Hawkman and many many more are hiding around town waiting for you to build the golden door so that when you do get to the free play modes you can pick and choose without always having to rely on the suits Also the DLC for this game which includes packs of five heroesvillains a piece is VERY inexpensive and is really there for the big comic fansThere are some nitpicky problems that I have with the game I wish that Green Lantern could shoot projectiles from his ring I wish The Flash could run straight up buildings like I stated nitpicky but the only problem I have with the game play is the flight mechanics are a little clumsy during the openworld segments and thats a pretty minor problem I know that many people who play coop are having some problems with the ingame camera coop play but since I dont even have another controller its honestly not something I could comment on Ideally these games are designed to play with another person so that they can join in the fun but Im more of a solo player anyway so its never been a concern Although my wife has expressed interest in playing this game with me as we did together with the first Lego Batman so I might be looking for another controller soonFor right now though LEGO BATMAN 2 is one fantastically entertaining game filled with action humor and joy and if youre a fan of the previous games this should be a really easy buy,5.0,A FANTASTIC time for kids of all ages,1345334400,"08 19, 2012",3

A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B0050SX9VO,Armando N Roman,"[2, 2]",The first Borderlands won me over with its great visual style and making me want to keep playing just to see how much stronger my weapons could get Its one of the only games where I wanted to get the Platinum trophy and I still plan on getting the Game of the Year edition just to finish all the extra missions even now all these years later I really liked the game and when the sequel was announced I was pretty excited Borderlands 2 does so much right that its hard to talk about the few gripes I have with it because theres so much good here A Game of the Year edition of the game was recently announced and itll be coming out very shortly Its going to be a fullprice game since it comes with everything AND the kitchen sink as far as DLC goes If youre on the fence about the game still though I highly recommend getting this regular edition since its so cheap now I dont play that many FPS games and when I do they tend to be more unique than the standard war games not that I have anything against those I cant say that Borderlands 2 changes the way we look at the FPS genre or anything but good lord did I enjoy playing the heck out of this oneBorderlands 2 has a relatively good story A dude named Handsome Jack has taken over Pandora and theres a resistance called the Crimson Raiders who want to stop him from going further with his plan Ill leave it at that since things are more deep here than they were in the first game and I dont want to ruin any of the twists Lets just say that if you played the first game youll see many familiar faces and 4 of them are given real character this time around making for a cast that is easy to get attached to I did like the story for the most part though most of the fun and time put into the game is in doing side missions If you were to ignore them altogether you can probably clear the game in 14 the time it would take to do everything in the first run Wheres the fun in that though The world of Pandora has a lot to see and shoot with bullets and loot chests everywhere Bandits Skags Hyperion robots and more are just as plentiful And as usual theres an ungodly amount of guns to go through its insane Two guns can look identical and have the exact same attributes in every category but one may have a slightly bigger magazine size or have better stability Elemental weapons are back too explosive fire corrosive electric and slag Basically if you loved the first game theres nothing here you wont likeIn the previous game you had four different classes This time around you can have up to 6 if you buy two of the DLC classes but you still have access to the main 4 from the get go They all play a little bit like the previous classes though one is essentially the same thing Axton the Commando is pretty much Roland the Soldier He has a rad turret that can be deployed as his action skill Use this to act as a distraction for your enemies while you take cover and recover or snipe them off from a distance Or just deploy it and shoot sidebyside Zero the assassin would be Mordecai the Hunter I suppose with his skill tree having a section that buffs his sniper skills He also has a unique ability that creates a hologram of himself to distract enemies while he turns invisible As the time runs out for this mode Zero will do more damage Want a great critical hit Hit em at the last possible moment Maya is another Siren like Lilith with a new ability She has a Phaselock which lets her levitate an enemy into an orb for several seconds making them a sitting duck It doesnt sound that good on its own but when you look at her skill tree and realize that this ability can draw in other foes cause everything around it to burn or melt and it can give Maya health if the enemy is killed while Phaselocked it quickly becomes clear that this skill rules And if the enemy is too strong like a boss or something they take raw damage instead of being trapped Finally theres Salvador the Gunzerker Do I need to say anything more than that he can use two guns at once with his skill ANY two guns A sniper rifle and a machine gun Sure A rocket launcher and a shotgun Why not Two rocket launchers Oh yeah he can do that too Something great about the classes this time around is that none of them are truly more efficient with a certain weapon type like they were in the previous game Yes some of their skill tree abilities help out with certain weapon types but x character isnt best with x gunThe game also has much better graphics and the soundtrack is just as memorable too My absolute favorite track comes from my favorite mission in the game the Circle of Slaughter Survive 5 rounds of an onslaught of Bandits while this killer track Bandit Slaughter is playing Seriously go search for that track and listen to it That sucker gets me pumped for Circle of Slaughter every time and I never get sick of hearing itTheres so much more I could talk about with this game to try and convince you that its worth playing Hopefully the low price gets it a little more attention now There are a few minor nitpicks I have though that keep it from being a 5 star title First its the same issue I had with the last game and its backtracking I got sooooooo tired of going between two areas over and over for certain missions or having to walk back through an area because the car couldnt pass through an entryway or something It seemed like the Fast Travel stations could have been placed better or there could have been maybe two per map to cut down on this Having them so far apart doesnt add challenge it just gets annoying after a while And maybe its just me creeping up on 30 in 3 years or Ive dealt with this kind of humor too much in other mediaits the writing A lot of the humor here will probably be enjoyed by a lot of gamers I liked some of it too just not when its variants of the same thing repeated over and over There were only a few times where I really laughed out loud Notably a robot who wants to  be human trying to think human things had some lines that were just plain comic gold Aside from that most of the threats from enemies are the kind of thing youd hear from a middle schooler who just watched South Park for the first time The only other thing Ill mention is that character animations could have been much better When two maijor characters in the town of Sanctuary are going over something terrible that Handsome Jack did theyre having a heated conversation with great voice acting yet theyll just wave one hand around while the other hand is on their hip and the other character is standing there in a neutral stance You couldnt put a little more effort into these animations Its nothing major at all just something that bugged me after a whileTiny complaints aside Borderlands 2 is a blast and one of the more memorable titles Ive played this generation Ill definitely be getting the Game of the Year edition when it comes out Until then Im going

review states even with all of its problems this is a game that all Wii owners should at least play through once Yes its very flawed but its so unique you owe it to yourself to play itYou play as SetoVoiced by Johnny Yong Bosch who does an amazingly gripping and tragic portrayal of the main character a young boy who lives with an old man he calls grampa in their observatory The game starts just as the old man passed away leaving behind a letter to Seto telling him to head west in search of other humans Some time before the start of the game something happened and almost all humans were killed in said event  After he leaves he encounters Ren the first living human girl he has ever seen Seto doesnt leave a good first impression on Ren and she runs away from him The story of the game involves you traversing the haunted of the ruined world looking for RenAs mentioned this games gameplay is horribly flawed  Thats not to say its broken or buggy as everything works fine from a programming standpoint The problems come from the horrifically uninspired gameplay mechanics  Your attacks are essentially Whack what is in front of you You cant move while attacking reducing your already limited mobility You also get a slingshot weaponAimed with the Wiimote in the game but I havent found this to be particularly useful except against boss fights because of their larger hit box The biggest problem with the combat in this game are the very small airborne enemies who will fly out of your attack range for far too long  Theres also the problem with weapons breaking which while probably realistic and understandable is extremely frustrating By and large you will be wandering around the dark landscape with a flashlight controlled by the Wiimote This also works well as I had no problems aiming turning and the camera worked fine as well  That said the game isnt very hard as you pretty much trip over health and save points You can also meet a merchant when you access a save point emphasis on the world can He shows up on random and it seems like hes almost programmed to stop whenever you dont want him there and just want to save and to never show up when you actually need himAs mentioned before most of the objectives involve fetch quests savaging various keys for various doors  This is made bearable as its just an excuse to traverse the dark creepy and strikingly beautiful landscape  The art is cel shaded giving the world a unique And well detailed look that reminds me of a very well animated anime shows That said I did find one portion of the game where the frame rate dipped dramatically This game is technically survival horror but its less about how frightened you are because of disturbing brutal and nightmarish creatures but more about the depressing cold atmosphere and the frightening undertones of the game As mentioned almost every human has died in some kind of catastrophe and here is where the real moments of brilliance come into play in the game  Theres something of a side gameplay element where you collect Mystery Items that you can identify when you head to a save point Sometimes theyre just items weapons or money but often times is an object that carries with a persons memories  When brought back to the save point it will activate a monologue by that person recounting their last moments alive Its very haunting and tragic and really helps set the tone for this gameSpoilersAs Ive said I feel I need to spoil a couple of things to show just how brilliant this game can be at times  By and large you are alone through out the game but not always The moments when you are alone are extremely unbearable to play through Not because of any problems or advantages having someone with you is but because of how bleak and depressing this game is without them The combat isnt exciting at all and the bleak dead world is hard to swallow  The first person you meet who accompanies you is a computer named PF who you find in a train station PF will talk to you give you hints and is generally nice to have around through the game Sadly her batteries are dying and she dies very early in the game leaving you during a gripping cut scene where she tells Seto how happy she was to have met him and how she wished they could have spent more time together before dying Its extremely painful actually and the gameplay once again feels very lonely and depressing The next person you meet is a boy named Crow who clearly isnt human He steals your pendant and you spend the next part of the game chasing him through an amusement park trying to get it back Normally this would annoy me in any other game but it was just nice to have someone there again even if all hes doing is taunting you putting you in danger and generally being a jerk He eventually leaves after you two become friends as he has his own journey hes on and youre back to square one again The way they juxtaposed the segments where you are with someone with the segments were you are alone is nothing short of a work of genius It adds so much to the tone of the game the feelings and the themes of fighting against isolationSpoiler EndThis games narrative is truly haunting memorable and deep  Its much deeper than what you usually get with video games This is a game that made me think  It effected me on an emotional level that most games do not  Despite the fact that the gameplay leaves much to be desired Which to be honest helps with the overall mood of the game being alone on a ruined Earth would be neither fun nor glamorous when combined it works so well that its something Im never going to forget  Combine this with a great voice acting cast great visuals and a gripping narrative you have a very solid title  While this game isnt a must love and its going to be very off putting to a lot of people its still a unique game that I believe all Wii owners really should play through onceProsGreat Voice WorkGripping NarrativeGreat Haunting visualsCons

the graphics werent suberb and even though I had seen the same video over and over on my computer screen at ign I was still blown away by it HalfLife 2 on the Xbox was just an incredible game and it was kindof sad for me to find out that I could run the game on PC even better I didnt want to go out and by another game that was exatly the same except for the two facts that graphics were better on PC and that you could also download a multiplayer componant for the PC versionAnyways like most people I was confused to an amount at the end of HalfLife 2 I wasnt mad though because you know what Valve is pulling off when they leave you hanging on a cliff They are making you thrive as much as you can to buy the next game that comes out so you can see what happenes They also pull off this stunt of making you want the next game even more by giving out little to no information about the next game When e3 2006 pulled around Valve said they would not be showing up probably because the game was a month away from release anywaysOkay the past two paragraphs might have possilby seemed pointless but I kind of wanted to give you a backround of things going through my head I am here to give you my thoughts and review of one of the most amazing games I have ever played in my life HalfLife 2 Episode One For any of you who are wondering this phrase Why not aftermath the box above says aftermath on it I will give you the answer so the next paragraph might take a little bit so if you know the answer to that question skip the next paragraphIt seems that Valve decided NOT to make an expansion pack called Aftermath This time they have decided to give us an episode No dont worry they are not giving us seizures though in a game like this you might expieriance one When I say episode I mean something like several parts to a game Or in simple terms while Valve takes the next few years or so to create a third game if they do they give a nice candy bar which takes around a year to create This candy bar if nibbled wisely will last you till you get your second candy bar which should be at the end of the year The idea of episodic games is quite smart and for this game Valve makes it seem quite sucessful And the storyline seems made for episodic contentOkay now that you know the purpose of episodic games and what they are let us continue into the next pahse the review itselfStoryline Last time I didnt give much of a good revealing to what happened in the storyline at the ending or the begining I wont reveal much this time either but for those of you have not played any of Halflife 2 HalfLife 2 is not required on your computer to run this game you can eiter listen to this and learn the little information that I will give you OR ignore the following sentances until you reach a long line just scroll down youll find it In HalfLife 2 you are sent by the GMan who is your puppeteer in a way to City 17 one of the few remaining earth cities Earth has been taken over by a ruthless group of creatures known as the Combine You fight with your allies Alyx Vance Dog Dr Kliner Eli Vance and a cool soldier named Barney NOT THE DINOSAUER You soon enough get to the Citedel which is where all the creatures and soldiers Combine soldiers and ships are coming from It is the main base of operations for the Combine Confront the person who said that Earth surrenders to the Combine Dr Wallace Breen and defeate him by destroying the Combines portal reactor Which results in a giant explsosion then the GMan reapears to take you awaySystem Requirements HalfLife 2 for the PC had one of the largest ranges for system requirements at the time for its release It could run on a extremely high system but the minimal requirements were extremely low so any computer that used it could probably run it well Valve continues to follow doing this requirements are exactly the same as HalfLife 2 for the PC Heres a listMinimal Requirements12 GHz Processor Speed 256MB RAM DirectX 7 Level graphics card Windows 2000XPME98 Mouse Keyboard Internet ConnectionRecommended Requirements24 GHz Processor Speed 512MB RAM DirectX 9 Level graphics card Windows 2000XP Mouse Keyboard Internet ConnectionMy computer easily reaches near the recommended zone I only have a 20 processor So you probably shouldnt have to worry about this area too muchYou will also need a DVD drive for this game if you buy it in stores instead of downloading it from SteamGraphics HalfLife 2 on the PC stunned the world with graphics and Valve did it again with a really spiffy update to some of their graphics while maintaining the same requirements as before like I said They are really incredible graphics with amazing facial expressions You should really try to put the character textures at high in the settings for this game At least the first chapter because its amazing to see how Alyxs face can show her signs of being fatigued sad worried happy amazed and so much more General textures are amazing at high but take large chunks out of that framerate of yours if it is at high Sadly I had to put it at medium which looks like the Xbox graphics not too appealing HDR stands for High Dynamic Range which is hard to explain but I will try to tell you how greatly it works in this game Take a sunny day at home and have a window shade covering half your window avoid letting any other lights in the room so it is quite dark compared to the rest of your home Now stare at an area in the room that barely has any light on it also make sure no light from the window is touching this surface Continue to stare at it for about 10 seconds When you are done look at surface near the window that has the light from the window shining on it The area should look enlightened to a large extent to the point where you can only see pure light you cant even see details on the surface clearly In due time it will not seem to bright anymore and you will see details on that surface again This is one of the features you will expieriance with HDR fully enabled in the game Not every level includes HDR just to know I was very happy to know that my computer ran this game with full HDR without large portions of framerate drop Whenever there is a game that has HDR it normally does not run that well at all The Rainbow Six Lockdown PC demo ran terribly with HDR and Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter does not even run on my computer I attempted to install the demo In the advanced graphic settings area in the menu there is stars next to the settings that Valve recommends you use in the game These settings from what I know are all different for each and every computer and they are quite trust worthy I get a very good balance of graphics and framerate with these settings the only dissapointment for me in these recomendations is that they say I should completely turn off AntiAliasing There is a large amount more on the graphics to this game but I feel I should press onGameplay An area large amounts of people look at Really the gameplay is very identical to the gameplay in HalfLife 2 intense But with Alyx fighting at your side throughout almost the entire game you get a different feeling There is a good variety of fun moments where Alyx will do something scripted like get into a sniper position and cover you as you advance into the next area pop the heads off of Zombines more about them later and more The gun training feeling that I mentioned in the HalfLife 2 review on Xbox is not integrated into the game as well this time But you dont really need it to be Also the locations you fight in have good variety this time like a dark scary low ammo power downed undergound highway Full of Zombines and Zombies Zombines are the names that Alyx gave to Combine soldiers that have been taken over by headcrabs They are quite tough creatures and take more than one shotgun blast to kill unlike normal zombies Youll also be fighting creatures more often this time considering the fact that the Combine defense if failing so there are more antlions and alike creatures making their way into City 17 Another place you fight in is obviously City 17 The Gravity gun is still there and you get another fun time to have it supercharged but it will die off in time Really this game wont last you long Five chapters long and something around 46 hours BUT Valve gives you a directors commentary included you dont need to go out and buy a limited edition or anything you already have a commentary which is really fun and nice Youll learn quite a bit about the clever minds of Valve and its amazing how they create simple things that you dont notice to give you such a great game So the replayabillity is still in the medium level enough to last me till Episode Two at the end of the year Also after you beat the game there is a sneak peak trailer for the next episode which I will not say anything about not even my opinion on it So you get quite a bit with twenty dollars  Also loading times which came often on the Xbox version but went by quickly are still here in HalfLife 2 Episode One This time the loading times happen less often but they last longer like a bathroom break longerOkay moving on again because I was running out of things to write about the gameplaySound As good as HalfLife 2 for PC HalfLife 2 on the Xbox had some strange differances with the sound than the PC version but it was good Also in this game if you set the video settings too high it is possilbe you might run into sound problems in the opening video but shouldnt happen Also the stuttering problems in sound compared to what Ive heard about the PC version of HalfLife 2 seem to be fixedMusic Ive said it before that Im not much a person who WRITES about music HalfLife 2 Episode One still has music that is strange but it still matches the game enjoyablyAI With HalfLife 2 Episode One the AI that was used incredibly with HalfLife 2 has been enhanced to even smarter levels than before Theyll still pull off smart flankings Zombines will charge you after you shoot them for the fist time they also at certain times pull out grenades and walk towards you while they hold it Which is funny watch when you have a whole group of Zombies around him Friendly character AI is mostly noticed with Alyx as she does a few cool instant kill moves Along with smart pistol shooting Really Valve said that they did not give Alyx too many good fighting attacks when shooting But what can be really cool is when you use your flashlight in the dark to let her see the enemies and she takes out the bad guysThe game is HalfLife 2 Episode One the developer is Valve This is the review and Im summing up what Ive typed for an hour and a half Hope you enjoy this game and be amazed that much,4.0,I dont think I have ever been more amazed,1149465600,"06 5, 2006",3

A1ZCFM6XK8WBE0,B000OLXX86,TheRumblePackcom,"[1, 1]",A long time ago in a galaxy not so far away BioWare the legendary creators of Dragon Age and Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic gave gamers their first epic multipathed Xbox 360 RPG with Mass Effect Released to much fanfare the heralded actionrpg hybrid allowed players to guide their own customized main character Commander Shepard and his recruitable multispecies crew through a scifi journey of galactic proportions  literally Fast forward to presentday Earth  while the masses are once again waiting to be affected by the sequel a select few of us that missed out on the first portion of the story or simply want our ingame decisions to carry over to the successor have decided to go back and try to save the original galaxy again before the day of second impact Fortunately while some of the creaks and cracks of yesteryear have fissured into eye sores since its original release the old girl has still largely got it where it countsLets start with the probably the best reason to play through the original game again the highly shapeable story and the dialogue system on which it rests Although BioWare fans will recognize this as the companys MO nearly every conversation and decision within  Mass Effect allows the player to select responses that lead to major and minor consequences Depending on whether you react to a situation with a coolheaded and diplomatic Paragon response or a hotheaded and likely more risky Renegade option or anything in between NPCs will come to either respect you or hate your guts open up to you or shut you out or ultimately be allowed to live or suffer a gruesome death Although not every detail of Commander Shepards adventures will be changed via this system  youll still fight the same bosses still be able to access the same shops and still have the same amount of selectable missions  its these major choices that the player is forced to make that have become Mass Effects true legacy I wont sugarcoat the situation  some of the decisions can be quite difficult but that only reinforces the success that BioWare has had in helping players establish meaningful connections to their ingame crew and support characters Their fate is quite literally in your controllergreased handsBut while youll delight in seeing the fruits of your dialoguebased decisions chances are that the combat wont live up to your modernday expectations Battles are carried out through a behind the shoulder thirdperson perspective with Shepard leading two of his fellow squadmates all with different traits and abilities of course into a coverbased shooter against armies of robots mercenaries and nogoodniks Each character has an assortment of different guns and special abilities that allow for an amusing combination of battle tactics at your disposal  you can suspend enemies in midair overload their weapons and disable their shields all before they hit the ground Unfortunately the cover system in which you try to stick as close to a wall as possible in hopes of automatically latching onto it can only be described as serviceable at best especially with other thirdperson shooters such as Gears of War setting a high bar over the past few years And while certain character classes such as the Soldier or Vanguard will have little trouble disposing of the legions of seemingly crackshot enemies despite this flawed mechanic others will be doomed to restarting the same battles multiple times due to an overexposed limb Add to this a fairly crude checkpoint system and you could find yourself repeating the same 20 minute battle over and over again complete with unskippable cutscenes and loss of saved player settings Suffice to say your learning curve may varyIts also surprising  again given its release  how well Mass Effects graphics still hold up While it certainly doesnt represent the bleedingedge of textures and polygons that it once was there are still quite a few aweinspiring moments to be found within the galaxy  especially during the last few missions And although some may blame unsynchronized voices and mouth movements on a general lack of polish and they might be right I find myself more willing to stick the rather uninspired sidemissions and exploration quests into that unfortunate possibility bucket No matter what the task might be whether its to rescue a sibling purchase a certain good or procure information for someone everything revolves around either too lengthy although admittedly welldone conversations or raids on generic buildings wiping out baddies for cash thats all but worthless With nearly every worthwhile weapon and piece of armor procured through chests along the main story arc theres even less reason to explore the dozens of additional planets littered throughout the galaxy most of them empty wastelands that contain some sort of mineral or artifact good only for cash or obsessive collection reliefBut despite the janky unbalanced combat the slightly outdated visuals and the largely uninteresting sidequests Mass Effect still manages to win over the majority of players through its thoroughly engaging story and dialogue system Its proofpositive that giving players a greater array of choices within their game will allow them to connect more strongly to it especially if the consequences are interesting heartfelt and permanent Its very little wonder why fans are excited for the sequel  we want to see how our actions will continue to affect all of our stories lack of polish be damned But while the new model is right around the corner dont hesitate to take the ol gal out for a ride if youre interested She might not look as pretty anymore but she still runs just fineReviewed by Nicolo Accordino,4.0,Mass Effect might not look

A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L,B001395JT4,Solid Snake,"[0, 0]",NOTE Before you purchase PenumbraBlack Plague you should know that this is the 2nd installment of a series of three episodes You can play Plague without having played Overture but if youre like me then youll regret not getting the entire collection from the startthe collection is also offered on Amazon at the time of writingYou see I was worried that I would not like this type of game A FPS without the S I didnt see how being defenseless was going to keep me interested for very long but that is the beauty of this game you cant just run around blowing everything up You have to explore piece together clues and adapt to the environment to surviveSynopsisPenumbra puts you in the shoes of a man on the search for answers  answers about the father you barely knew answers that you may not be prepared to hear The search takes you to your fathers last known location a remote and secretive facility in Greenland buried deep within the glacial ice It doesnt take long for you to discover that something has gone terribly wrong here and unraveling the history of this place and what part your father played in it is the mystery that drives this adventureGame PlayThe mechanics of Penumbra are simple  you can walk run crouch and jump just as in any other FPS Looking around with the mouse will reveal objects that you can interact with Some you can add your sparse inventory others you pick up or manipulate in some way Items in your inventory can sometimes be combined to create new items and figuring out how combine them is often a central piece of the puzzle you must solve to proceed Another interesting aspect of the game is how you use objects that you cant add to your inventory Rather than clicking once on say a door and having it swing open or closed you grab objects and move them just like you would in real life That means that you can slowly open doors to peak out drawers valves and levers react according to your hand motions rather than being clicktoactivate and so on Many objects can also be investigated that is you can get your characters impressions of what he is looking at Often this is no more than a way to set the atmosphere and provide a visceral element The stench from this sink is unbearable but it also serves as a way to provide hints for how to proceed This door looks weak I wonder if I can find a way to force itThere arent any weapons in this game  sorry Mr Freeman but theres not even a trusty crowbar to fall back on  but then again there really arent that many enemies either When you do encounter a monster your only option is to run and hide or to barricade yourself in room until they wander off again You cant even look at the enemies directly without experiencing a simulated panic Your vision will blur your heart will pound in your ears and your breathing turns to ragged gasps This game simply is not about combat its about the experience the whole point is to immerse you in this twisted mystery to make you feel vicariously at least your characters disempowerment and isolation At that it succeeds admirablyStoryThe story is engrossing enough although it treads through mostly familiar territories  suffice it to say that most of the central elements have appeared in film and novels in some form The execution is competent and well paced and the atmosphere and characters are more than engaging enough to keep you interested I believe that those that played the first installment will find the conclusion thoughtprovoking and somewhat of a twist but without being overthetop ridiculous I should also mention that the voice acting is superb and lends the few characters in the story a great deal of personalityAny complaintsWell its too short but if you take the full series into account youve got a complete game On its own Black Plague is a 23 day diversion even for a casual gamer Replay value is practically zilch because honestly you cant really be surprised the second time around can you The puzzles can really only be solved one way so theres not much a second run can offer you on that front eitherIf I have one truly legitimate complaint about Penumbra it is the lack of depth in the environments Im not talking about the graphics necessarily which for an indie game are quite good really but rather the lack of diversity in the objects and textures Its a bit disappointing that more attention was not paid to fleshing out the generic rooms and hallways of the facility It also would have been nice to have more areas to explore that were entirely optional and just added for depth and to reward the more curious players However this can be attributed to the small scale of the development team and is a small price to pay for a truly fantastic gameplay experienceBottom LineLooking for a Bioshock or Halflife title Is the only good zombie a dead zombie Then Penumbra is not for you If you want a somewhat different action game something that offers a genuine scare or two and some interesting puzzles to solve then get the whole collection now  as Penumbras protagonist implores right from the start dont make the same mistakes

A3UJX4L5AKUWQM,B00004TNDE,Liquid Identity OCW,"[7, 7]",Dark Mirror is one of many in the long line of Syphon Filter games It carries on the tradition of excellent thirdperson shooting action serving as the foundation for a twisting plot of intrigue and conspiracy A sensitive incident at a refinery in Alaska leads to an investigation by agent Gabe Logan and his covert team What they uncover is not what they expected and when things just dont add up they dig deeper slowly adding pieces to the puzzle of a deadly conspiracy In order to keep up with the story its important to find hidden evidence on each level and read the files in your inventory They provide essential details to story progress Without them they arent necessary its sometimes difficult to figure out the whos and whys of what is going on The twists and turns come fast and apart from the occasional unaccounted for gap due to missing intel the story is solid Deception abounds and Dark Mirror feels more like a mystery than past tactical espionageoriented Syphon Filter gamesThis time around the missions are presented in smaller pieces with simpler designs You can sit down and play through one part of a mission in under 10 minutes There are checkpoints within these bitesized areas at critical locations so you never have to backtrack far if you die or do something that results in mission failure The levels themselves are fairly straightforward and linear but it doesnt feel too constrained and there is room for tactical experimentation as well as secrets to findMost of the time you will be moving sneaking shooting aiming and taking cover Stealth has always been a staple of Syphon Filter and it is well represented in Dark Mirror Doing things quietly often ensures resistance along your path is lighter However stealth is not necessary in most cases and there is no severe punishment for attempting it and being caught You can get a rush of anticipation as you sneak around your quarry or you can get a rush of adrenalin when they spot you and assault you full force However you want to play it Dark Mirror will accommodate youWhen you do get into trouble you can now take cover along walls or behind obstacles This is a new addition to Syphon Filter gameplay and while it isnt a new gaming concept it has been done properly here Not sticking your neck out needlessly can save your life but with Dark Mirrors fairly easy difficulty you can usually opt to just stand in the open and fire if youre quick on the trigger Again this allows casual gamers to enjoy the action while allowing more tacticallyminded individuals to be more deeply involved in the battlefieldEnemies are unpredictable yet intelligent many times using cover as you would When they have you outnumbered they take advantage of the situation to put pressure on you and ferret you outThere is a very nice assortment of weapons and devices for Gabe and company to use Pistols shotguns assault rifles sniper rifles submachineguns experimental weaponry explosives grenades etc At any one time you can carry one sidearm one submachinegun one rifle sniper or otherwise the experimental agency rifle you carry at all times a melee weapon and an explosive The experimental rifle shoots darts of various types explosive poison gas or electric shock Firearms have varying attributes and fire modes so some are better under certain circumstances Generally speaking though most any gun can get the job done for you so its almost never a matter of not having the right tool for the job With all of these toys at your disposal its a ton of fun for anyone who loves guns Again Dark Mirror makes itself accessible to casual gamers and hardcore shooter fans alikeYou also have access to a set of hightech goggles that have three different modes night vision infrared and electromagneticArmor and medkits are places around the levels and provide a quick refresh after particularly intense areasThe graphics are neat and clean While the PS2 can push out more dazzle than is presented in Dark Mirror this game succeeds in looking fantastic in its simplicity If youre used to the highend CG cutscenes of late you may be a little disappointed in the movies Dark Mirror provides but the ingame action still looks goodThe sound is decent with some good voice acting and a lot of spoken lines during play I cant help but feel there could be a little more oomph to the guns and some more environmental sounds but again Dark Mirror succeeds in its simplicity The music is provided by several composers including the ubiquitous Mark Snow Nothing terribly rousing here but it keeps pace with the highs and lows of the actionDespite these easy to swallow portions and an emphasis on simplicity there is a lot on the table to enjoy and Dark Mirror offers about 10 hours of story playtime In addition there is a Mission Mode where you can replay levels and earn ratings in tactical areas such as headshots stealth kills use of rifle darts survivability and knife skills For your performances you are awarded badges of merit and these patches unlock additional weapons abilities such as increased health and new bonus levels Earning full ratings for each level usually requires you to play through it a few more times each time focusing on a different tactic Due to the quickfire nature of the missions this is quick and fun but can eat up a lot of time in the long run making Dark Mirror very replayableDark Mirror is quite enjoyable It doesnt shoot itself in the foot by catering to casual or hardcore action gamers Instead it allows for both and does so admirablyOn a final note Dark Mirror was brought over to the PS2 after being made for the PSP Everything was designed for quick portable gaming in mind This accounts for the short mission structure somewhat easy gameplay its much easier to move and aim with a PS2 controller and allround simplicity as opposed to more complex games like SOCOM or Metal Gear Solid Fortunately Dark Mirror is a shining example that satisfying gameplay and quality content dont necessarily imply complexity,4.0,A fun accessible game that offers a solid albeit light thirdperson shooter experience,1197244800,"12 10, 2007",3

A3J4ZG0O2YGVKZ,B003B3V0MA,Shaun Cooley,"[18, 19]",As an avid fan of words in general I decided upon learning of its existence to purchase 100 Classic Books for the Nintendo DSFirst things first all of the books included in the software are now out of copyright so some people will invariably scoff at the idea of paying actual money for them particularly since they can be had legally for free on places like  This is certainly a valid point My feelings on the matter are thus I like to read but I am not terribly fond of reading books on the computer Had I an ereader such as the Kindle or the Nook there might be little reason for me to purchase a title such as this However decent ereaders are still relatively expensive and then theres the cost of a cover or case to help protect the thing and possibly the optional protection plan etc  Without having used one at any length Im not sure whether or not it would be worth it to me to drop the coin required for such a purchaseSince I already have a DS making a small purchase like 100 Classic Books is a much easier pill to swallow in order to dip my toe in the waters of ebook readingWhen the title starts up there is a pleasant and soothing tune playing as an owl flies across a row of books and settles on the nontouch screen to watch you The owl also serves another feature If the thought of choosing what to read from the 100 books available is somewhat daunting you can ask the owl for a recommendation Hell ask you a few questions about what you want to read length genre reading level etc and make a suggestion based on your answersYou can also get recommendations through the online rankings Once you connect to the Nintendo WFC you can update the rankings on the books and there will be stickers applied to various books that are the highest rated in several categories most romantic most humorous most scary best overall book etc This is a neat little feature but wholly unnecessary particularly since most people wont want to keep going online just to update the rankings again and again Whilst connected to Nintendo WFC you also have the option to download ten additional books to the software which immediately integrate themselves into the bookshelf theres a little DL on the bottom of the spine of each book so you can see which ones are hardcoded in the software and which are DLCYou can recommend books yourself after youve finished reading them or after youve skipped ahead to the last page and finished the book if youre just eager to give a high rating to your favorite book You get to rate it from 1 to 10 and then pick an adjective that describes it the adjectives correspond to the categories a book can be stickered inThere are really only two things that are important in a title such as this and thats the quality of the books and the quality of the interfaceIve typed up a list of the books at the bottom of this review and there is quite a large variety available across all genres which is a plus With authors ranging from Louisa May Alcott to Oscar Wilde and the books themselves going from 20000 Leagues Under the Sea to Wuthering Heights there is literally something enjoyable here for practically anyone who even remotely likes to readThe one big problem I had with the books is that there are sporadic typos to be found As an example theres a passage in The Jungle Book which erroneously says hoys instead of boys on page 376 if you are using the standard font size Theyre not everywhere but I found a couple in the Jungle Book and elsewhere Ive only read a few books in the game However they are very offputting when you find them and it puts a bit of a taint on what is otherwise a very solid titleAs for the interface it is so intuitive that practically anyone could figure it out within a matter of seconds However theres also a tutorial that plays the first time you start the game which you can skip if you so desire You hold the DS sideways like a book  clever no and you can use either the buttons or the screen to turn the page The dpad or face buttons depending on whether youre a righty or lefty can be used to turn the page left or right and you can optionally set the shoulder buttons to change pages as well On the screen itself tapping the left or right side of the touch screen will turn the page back or forward You can also slide the stylus across if you want a more realistic pageturning motionYou can set up to three different bookmarks per book This is nice if you have a particular passage that you want to refer to later or if you have multiple people reading off one cartridge If you want to remove a bookmark just go to that page and take it out Or you can simply place it somewhere else in the book and it will move automatically you dont have to go and pick it up before you can set it down somewhere else which is niceThe font size can be changed between two settings and I found both to be quite easy to read Theres also several background ambient noise choices you can use Some of them are a little unpleasant actually both the music selections of Classic and Easy Listening sounded a little too harsh and synthesized for me to enjoy reading by but I found some that were very relaxing and actually enhanced the reading experience Summer Night is my favorite but Moving Train and Park are both good tooIts obvious that a lot of work went into making the interface as smooth and as intuitive as possible and it really shows Its extremely well thought out though its not perfect One glaring omission is the lack of a dictionary to look up unfamiliar words I understand that the Kindle has a builtin dictionary for just such a purpose With all the books being from 1922 or prior it is not uncommon to run into many unfamiliar words particularly from the international authors such as Tolstoy Kipling or Hugo Secondly theres no search functionality Unless youve bookmarked the page youre stuck hopping from page to page looking for whatever phrase or quote you wanted to find Another feature that would have been nice though it isnt strictly necessary is a texttospeech feature also included in the latest model of the Kindle Synthesized speech has made many advances over the past decades and although its not perfect it would be nice to be able to turn on a texttospeech function if I wanted to listen to a book whilst browsing Amazon for exampleOne of the other interesting things you might notice is a lack of an ESRB rating for this title Apparently due to the content being entirely literaturebased this title does not require any age classification Granted it doesnt affect the software in any way but it might be a bit of a collectors oddity for this reasonSo as I mentioned at the top of the review I basically purchased this as an experiment to see whether I would get any use out of an ereader before I whip out the wallet and buy one So how did the experiment go  Well I just placed my order for a KindleAnd

A5HLP2DD2F4R2,B000CBCVH2,B A Gibson Gatewalker,"[22, 25]",Im not sure what exactly I was expecting when I loaded up Rumble Roses XX for the first but I do remember I wasnt expecting to be impressed  So much for prejudgmentRumble Roses XX turned out to be a pretty sweet gameFirst off I have to say I rarely ever play wrestling games  The last one I played was on the Dreamcast and I thought it sucked the game not the system  So if there is any common criteria by which such games are judged by I am unaware of them  I can only comment on what I liked and disliked about the titleThat said I must say there wasnt much about the title I didnt likeRumble Roses XX is a wrestling game  All of the standard characters you play with are female There are a variety of play modes to enjoy and entertain you and your friends withThe graphics are gorgeous and Im not just talking about those lovely polygon models that you wrestle with though they are err composed very well  The stages you play on are richly detailed and beautiful  The soundtrack never seems to be inappropriate every song or tune seems to match the moment it is played  The character models are well designed and well animated  Most model motions are smooth fluid and natural looking with the odd exception of the execution of a few of the holding moves  Im pretty sure most normal people cant bend like these character models can bendGraphics sounds and pretty polygons are all done very well but all those points would amount to nil without good game play to enjoy them with  Fortunately Rumble Roses XX has very solid but simple game play  Nearly all moves are executed by hitting a single direction and a button  Special moves are executed by positioning yourself correctly and hitting a simple combination of buttons usually no more than two  The most annoying control issue is the mashing of buttons to escape holds or pins but that seems to be a universal design flaw among almost all wrestling games Ive read aboutYou can participate in a variety of different match types against a computer opponent  You have the traditional one on one match the tag team match battle royal free for all matches handicapped matches two on one and humiliation matches  With the exception of the humiliation match in all of these you win by pinning your opponent to the mat or having them submit to a holdRumble Roses XX has in addition to the wrestling mode a street fighting mode  This is a sort of simplified Street Fighter type fighting mode  Your wrestling moves are limited and you have a life bar You win a round by simply pummeling your opponent until their life bar is empty and you win a fight by winning two out of three rounds  It does make for a nice change of pace from the normal wrestling matchesComplementing the primary wrestling focus of this title there is a collecting aspect that features many things may be unlocked  Each character has many outfits you can acquire  These outfits run the range from very revealing thong bikinis and suggestive shorts to combat gear and school girl outfits  There is a photo shoot mode where you can take pictures of  the characters wearing the outfits you have unlocked while they participate in special activities you have also unlocked like riding a bike swimming or stretchingAlso in addition to unlocking additional outfits each character has a counterpart that can be unlocked  The game has a face versus heel arrangement good guy versus bad guy  Each face character has a heel version you can unlock and the same goes for the heel characters  Each character version has her own unique outfit and intro movieIn addition to playing against the computer there is an Exhibition Mode where you can play against up to three friends and use the outfits you have unlocked  All of the wrestling match types along with the street fighting mode are available  Ive found this to be a very enjoyable element of the gameRumble Roses XX lets you online to play against others and even lets you share photos you have takenThere are only three things about this game that annoy me all fairly minorThe first thing that I found annoying is that it is a great pain to change a characters costume in the Exhibition Mode  You can only change the color of the outfit your wrestler is wearing or pick her Super Star outfit if it is available  To change the outfit to something different you have to exit out of the exhibition mode load up your single player character change her costume there then go back to the Exhibition Mode  Very annoying of you have four people who keep wanting to change outfitsThe second most annoying thing I found about Rumble Roses XX is that it is unclear what you are supposed to do in the single player mode and how you progress in the game  If it is explained in the manual I overlooked it  I just kept playing matches until I won a titleThe last thing that annoyed me about this game and this is really the most minor is that there was no kind of training mode  I guess Ive played too many fighting games where this feature is provided and Ive come to expect itOver all I have to say I enjoyed this game greatly  Its entertaining to play by yourself and is a great title to bring out when your friends come overUnexpectedly Rumble Roses XX turned out to be a really sweet smelling rose without any thorns,4.0,Such a sweet smelling rose,1168041600,"01 6, 2007",3

A2582KMXLK2P06,B00002SVET,B E Jackson,"[1, 6]",I give Donkey Kong Land a rating of 4 out of 5Ive decided to update my review four years later because my original review was not only extremely negative and not only wrong but also a bit disrespectful as well I apologize for thatYes I was hating on Donkey Kong Land pretty hard and heavy during my original review and I even reached a boiling point where I said Id never touch the game againMy reason for that immature episode of anger was simply because I preferred the Donkey Kong Country series and Donkey Kong Land felt like a cheap imitation in comparison  However playing through DKL again I realize the error of my ways  I was completely wrong to dismiss this game originallyFirst of all the levels in Donkey Kong Land are NOT a direct ripoff of the ones in DKCSure the temple water and factory themes make an appearance but its not fair for me to say they are direct ripoffs of the levels in Donkey Kong Country when the levels were actually designed completely differentlyBy different I mean the levels are not trying to be like the ones in the DKC series at all instead the game makers took advantage of the popular themes in Donkey Kong Country and used those same themes to create something else entirely with completely different objectives and whatnotIn other words the gameplay involving collecting bananas stomping on enemies heads and everything else is exactly the same as in the Donkey Kong Country series the levels themselves are NOT the same as the ones in the DKC seriesIm actually really surprised that the water stages for example are significantly more fun here than they are in the DKC series  Theyre also much harder too  Actually the water stages feel twice as long in comparison to the ones in DKC which is rather odd considering the DKC series appeared on the Super NES the console where ideas were normally utilized to their full potential  It seems like the water stages were more thought out in this gameThe stage where a squid is chasing you through a deep underwater maze is definitely really creepy because he never STOPS chasing you but more importantly these water stages are really exciting and challenging  Im really surprised how significantly more fun and challenging the water and temple stages are in comparison to the ones in the DKC seriesOn the flipside however the jungle stages are definitely worse than the ones in DKC  This is because theyre usually quite short and not much attention to stage design was given compared to other stages in the gameThe boss fights are really simple because the strategy required to defeat them is usually something extremely basic and easy to figure out but thats a minor flaw  That doesnt mean the final boss fight is a cakewalk though he really tests your ability to move quickly during his final phaseMany of the enemies from the DKC series return in addition to plenty of new ones  Bees rats snakes and crocodiles are back  Other types of enemies such as floating crabs spiky fish flying pigs tornadoes hey they mine as well be enemies and snakes on ropes yes thats right are new and exciting additions  Rambi and Expresso are back but Winky and Enguarde are not  Perhaps that explains why the water stages are longerOne big flaw however is probably due to a Game Boy limitation  Remember in Donkey Kong Country whenever you run and jump you actually go pretty farWell in Donkey Kong Land whenever you run and jump for some reason Donkey Kong and Diddys animation slows down drastically so you almost hang in mid air which means you never actually leap in the air very far which means you basically have to stand right next to the edge of a cliff in order to make it across to the next platform  It seems while youre holding a barrel you jump a bit further though  Weird  Either way after a while youll learn to adjust to it just fine so it wont present much of a problemOh and Donkey Kong doesnt slap the ground anymore  Thats slightly disappointing because I used to like slapping bananas out of the dirtThe reason the game is challenging is because enemies are placed in spots that sneak up on you pretty quickly  In other words enemies will probably be walking where you least expect  Also the game is stingy with 1up balloons for some reason  Theres a distinct lack of bananas compared to DKC which means getting 100 of them for extra lives definitely doesnt happen as frequently compared to DKCSome of the levels are really strange  The mine cart levels are gone and in their place are levels involving these platforms that you ride  These are quite possibly the hardest stages in the game especially this one you will encounter later on where you have to jump in the air in order to make the platforms move in the direction you desire  Youll see what I mean here when you play the gameThe graphics are REALLY good  Seriously  Considering this is a Game Boy game the only flaw is actually one that makes me feel like Im nagging when I mention it the graphics are in black and white  Thats basically the only difference compared to the Donkey Kong Country version  Oh and the music is actually a lot more melodic and creative too  I love just about every single theme song  Most Game Boy games have boring music not this oneIn the end the number one reason this game is so good is because each and every level is positively loaded with fun things to do  One moment youre collecting bananas and coins the next youre either jumping through barrels riding up and down ropes swinging around jumping up and down on tires riding platforms to faraway places tossing barrels or defeating all kinds of beautifully animated enemies  The fun seriously never ends  This game rulesOverall a pretty solid game that I definitely didnt appreciate when it was first released  Nowadays I can play Donkey Kong Land and say its just really fun and NOT a ripoff of Donkey Kong Country,4.0,I was wrong,1150934400,"06 22,

A1HX04JEY9MR3,B0009S4UOK,C Bakehorn,"[9, 13]",There are good firstperson shooters out there Those shooters contain a story that captivates the player enough to blast through a dozen or so levels of shooting dodging and grenadelobbing Those levels generally have multiple objectives that are varied from bombing a structure to rushing a certain location and killing everything from point A to point B while staying alive Those shooters are generally accompanied with attractive graphics and pulsepounding music The Xbox 360 version of Quake 4 doesnt have many of those qualities Its not a terrible game but its one of the least impressive shooters Ive played this yearIn Quake 4s brainless campaign youll strap on the armor of the space marine Matthew Kane a member of the Rhino Squad that is attacking the evil Strogg on their home planet The biomechanical beasts are foul dirty and ruthlessand a small twist near the middle of the game will show you and Corporal Kane just how dirty the Strogg can be I thought that it was nice for Raven to throw in a truly unexpected story twist but I never really found the rest of the game to be very interesting At least the second half of the campaign is fast frantic and intense Its preferable to the first half Overall the game is about 1012 hours long clocking in at or near the shooter averageIts the gameplay that had me let down and shaking my head Quake 4 plays like a good first person shooterfrom 2001 The fragging is so ridiculously generic from the start of the game until the very end Some will say its just Quakes traditional gameplay I say its boring Youll pick up progressively stronger and better guns but at the same time your enemies get a little faster a little bigger an a little more deadly Theres a balance established between strong weapons and strong enemies However most of the action consists of running forward throughout similar rooms finding the Strogg and shooting them until they fall over and their corpses disappear They dont move around much at all they often dont even try to evade your fire and they dont try to outsmart you in the slightest bit Usually theyll stand in place move towards you and shoot you without taking much cover or attempting to get around you for an easier kill A few of the enemies have different tactics but these tactics are usually just slight variations from the standandshoot or runandslash strategy Its disappointing when games like Call of Duty 2 have such impressive intelligenceThe guns you get can be pretty cool but I discovered that almost anything can be killed quickly and effortlessly with a few wellplaced shotgun blasts or an entire clip of machine gun ammo even near the end of the game The enemies dont take much cover which is an example set for the playerrunning around and mindlessly shooting doesnt have many repercussions because it isnt necessary to hide very often Because of this even inexperienced gamers can plow through this games action If you have to play through this game play it on a hard difficulty setting unless you simply want to cruise right on through it The only things that break up the action even the slightest bit are a few vehicular distractions which are admittedly a lot of fun One of them puts you on the back of an onrails truck shooting off the Strogg with your own weapons The next throws you into the cockpit of a hovering tank where you can quickly fire off missiles and pound the opposition with machine gun fire The most exciting and last vehicle is the walker which can use lockon missiles and machine gun fire to rapidly take down enemies These distractions are a lot of fun and its a shame that the rest of the game is so genericMultiplayer on and offline isnt any more interesting than the singleplayer What should have been a robust fastpaced frantic set of games turns out to be pretty dull and generally unexciting Eight people can join up in a single game and of course you can frag each other in deathmatches but there isnt anything here that impressed me in the slightest bit All these years Ive heard about how much fun Quake can be in terms of multiplayer and Im let down by gameplay that simply isnt interesting Not to mention Xbox Live is very inconsistent and the alreadylow frame rate which Ill mention momentarily makes Quake 4 more frustrating to play than it ever should have beenVisually it is very difficult to classify Quake 4 There were certain parts during the game that I was admittedly impressed with Ravens choice for art and style There is a lot of detail throughout the environments from bloodsplattered walls to gears and mechanisms scattered around the various rooms Even the nicelylit interior locations which compose most of the game are interesting Corridor shooting isnt nearly as repetitive when the bulk of the graphical factor isnt stale and boring On the other hand player models are very generic and almost every marine looks like his partners One marine might have different hair and another might have a different skin color The models also look so jagged without a highresolution screen that it appears they have spikes or fur Quoting a friend Quake 4 has cactus graphics The effects are extremely dull whether its the Nintendo 64calibur muzzle flash or the fire and smoke effects that would look at home in a generic Playstation 2 game The music isnt very good either Where Perfect Dark Zero set a mood with its tunes Quake 4 does nothing to pump the player up for any battle or confrontation Its not epic its not exciting and it fails to impress me at all The voice acting is alright but the dialogue is so cliched and generic that it cancels out any sort of impressing aural qualityOverall Quake 4 is a big disappointment What was supposed to be a visually stunning fastpaced pulsepounding shooter ends up being one of the most dull launch titles on the Xbox 360 The story is interesting enough to pull you through 10 hours of generic and brainless action and the vehicular distractions are a quick and effortless blast but thats about the furthest Quake 4 goes If youre a Quake fan I wouldnt question you if you rented the game but Id have to frown down on anyone who decides to buy this game There isnt enough here in terms of depth or new modern shooter attractions Pick up Perfect Dark Zero or Call of Duty 2 instead

A1YEPFLLH42OU1,B000E0XX9Q,Yujin amp Tracy Chia YuJin Chia,"[4, 4]",As someone that loved the old infinity engine CRPGs Baldurs Gate Icewind Dale Planescape Torment and quite liked the original Neverwinter Nights despite its issues I had pretty high hopes for this game In fact I got it pretty much on the day it was released You can probably tell by the date of this review that it rather failed to arrest my attention NWN 2 is a game that by all rights should have been great Unfortunately it suffers from some very serious unavoidable basic flaws that totally cripple the fun factorAs one can expect the game engine and graphics are new and improved You can certainly tell by how much longer it takes to load areas and how big a drag on system resources this game becomes Even current systems at the time of this writing lag at some points in the game and if your machine is borderline you can expect major issues even if you have everything turned down to minimum In fact NWN 2 is more taxing on your PC than a lot of games that look a whole lot better and on that note it actually does NOT look a whole lot better than the old NWN Character models are especially bad and before you say thats just a game engine limitation check out The Witcher sometime it uses the same one I dont know how Obsidian could have neglected character appearance when its probably the most critical visual factor in a game like this but they did Sound and effects are fortunately a lot better and this makes it somewhat tolerable in the multimedia departmentThe gameplay is sort of a mishmash between Baldurs Gate and NWN You have more control over companions and can do some things like determine how they level up or control them directly in combat if you wish Unfortunately you probably will HAVE to take direct control because the AI is absolutely atrocious You thought the pathfinding in Baldurs Gate was bad It looks positively brilliant compared to this NWN2 is a new low characters getting stuck behind each other or on empty terrain for no reason running right into a room filled with traps not attacking enemies directly in front of them spellcasters choosing to melee instead of casting healers not healing party members that are on the verge of death the list goes on and on Fortunately theres some free downloadable hacks that go quite a ways towards fixing the AI and if you want to progress through the game at anything approaching a reasonable pace these are absolutely mandatory On an additional note you cant multiclass any of your companions in the campaign all you can do is assign points and feats which is a shame Your main character can pick up to 4 total classes though the level cap of 20 limits you somewhat limited in terms of viabilityThe NWN 2 campaign has an overhead map that may bring back memories of Baldurs Gate However the campaign more or less shoehorns you into going into certain places in a certain order and isnt a whole lot less linear than the old NWN Theres some halfhearted attempts at side quests including some companion quests and a phase where you get to manage your own castle but its nothing like Baldurs Gates extensive character development and exploration If youve played BG12 youll end up sorely disappointed for a while it looks like NWN 2 is headed in the same direction and then it all just sort of stops or gets dumbed down to boredom Its an improvement over NWN in this regard but it has a long long way to go to get to the level of even the original Baldurs Gate As far as the campaign story goes its pretty runofthemill No real surprises not particularly imaginative in short a whole lot like the lackluster original NWN campaign Ive yet to try out the expansions for this game and itll probably be some time before I do on account of how little I enjoyed this campaign Even on a loot note theres not a whole lot to be had I started noticing a lot of duplicate items about halfway through and after checking the total lists with the toolset I was appalled by how few items there are in the game not to mention how dumb most look Most of them arent even provided with any interesting background just generic statsTheres a few additional and new features that have potential The game uses the DD 35 rules and is somewhat more streamlined than the original It still takes a bit of slot juggling to figure out what stacks with what but a lot of the weirder things have been simplified or removed There are new races including some that are more powerful than the standard ones and thus incur a level penalty not a good thing considering theres only 20 levels Theres a new base class in the campaign the warlock and a decent collection of prestige classes Unfortunately due to the cap and the fact that you cant multiclass your companions you probably wont get to experience most of the latter unless you either cheat or keep replaying the campaign which as noted above is not exactly great fun Theres also some new item creation feats and skills though in practice I found them to be too difficult to keep track of and not a whole lot of use anyway Theres also attempts at replay value in the campaign using the new influence system but most of these come very late in the game and dont have a very serious impact on what actually happens anyway Theres also not a whole lot of motivation for doing what few optional quests there are since most are quite boring and as with the original NWN youll hit the cap before you finish either wayAs for character customization you can alter appearance name skills feats and class In general you really want to stick with one type of class eg if you choose to be a spellcaster you should stick with that and related prestige classes Trying to get your character to do everything makes you pretty weak all around since this isnt an epic campaign Then again if you dont really care about having a powerful main character do whatever The game isnt particularly hard and your companions can probably take up the slack As with NWN you can use skills in some dialogue choices and world actions though aside from bluffintimidate these are pretty darn rare In particular skills like listen survival and intimidate are so rarely used they might as well have just taken them out Some reviewers have said that the game favors melee classes but this is definitely not true once you get out of the noob stage In fact I would say spellcasters are favored in the latter two thirds of the game on account of how many huge packs of weak monsters you encounter nothing like AOE to clean that up right quick You can rest almost anywhere and it only takes a few seconds which makes memorized spell limits a nonissue unless you get into a really drawnout fight not common That aside seeing spells go off is one of the only real highlights of the games combat system weapon based attacks are so boring you dont even watch after a whileI do believe NWN 2 has potential and the expansions may manifest that So could player made content since the toolset allows you to change practically anything However the outofbox NWN 2 campaign is barely an improvement over the NWN1 original campaign that one fortunately got better with expansions but the original was a bore and really didnt hold my attention It looks rushed unfinished in graphic and quest design and has tons of new angles that could have been really cool if they were actually done right The simple sad fact is that theres a lot of better RPGs out there and have been since NWN 2s release which is why it took me so long to get through this game In that light I really cant recommend this title,2.0,Could really have been better,1260230400,"12 8, 2009",3

A3BPA8OCXCEW2I,B007A7UJ4S,Alfred D jorius whitman,"[3, 4]",There are plenty of reviews telling you how awesome this game is and for the most part they are true Id like to drop some notes about things in the game that annoyed me while playing it since few reviews seem to do that at all Lousy AI Frankly the AI of your teammates leave a lot to be desired You seemingly can only change the actions they can or cant take in battle and only if you control the people characters themselves On top of that the lack of options the game gives you when setting what actions to take are frustratingly low Invariably it came down to two choices for me Either tell them not to take any actions or watch them waste all their mana needlessly in the most awful situations IE using special moves when an enemy is about to die to the next melee swing etcyoud imagine that setting a character to Keep Us Healthy would mean they would conserve mana to heal but alas they use most of it to attack and when you need heals you end up doing most if not all of it yourself Low capture rate Im sure youve read or heard this game has a Pokemon aspect to it by now The game has over 250 different monsters for you to capture and for each and every one of them the only way to capture them is with Esther on roughly a 56 chance the monster will be captureable This is a stark contrast to Pokemon where you can throw a Pokeball at anything you want at any time Be prepared to spend hours sometimes trying to capture something specific with no alternatives except to pray that one of these fights youll finally be able to capture it Melee attacks can be blocked Not in a traditional sense as in with a shieldthat would be fine but any melee familiar you use will invariably run into clipping issues trying to reach the mob its supposed to attack Meanwhile it swings away at the air in front of it missing everything until it can reach the mob One would think clippingpathing issues would be resolved before the game released but apparently this was ignored AoE Attacks interrupt everything in battle For the uninitiated AoE is Area of Effect meaning attacks that hit everything on the screen Whenever your characters and their familiars does any attack or even heals that hit everything at once such as Earsplitter you are treated to a minicutscene of it happening What this does unfortunately is it wipes out any move that was cast but animation did not finish For example if you were trying to charm a mob and Esthers harpplaying animation did not finish yet and an AoE spell went off it effectively cancels your charm attempt and you have to do it all over again For charm there is no cooldown but for other spells such as Swaines trick shots there areand yes getting your move cancelled this way puts in on cooldown This is highly annoying over the course of the game as a lot can happen in a few seconds every battle and having your moves put on cooldown arbitrarily is horrible Lackluster ending Not necessarily a flaw but man was it disappointing If youre playing this game with the hopes that at the end of it youll be treated to some Studio Ghiblianimated ending with some insight on what the characters are up to since you beat the game youll be sorely disappointed There is a semblance of that but it is so short and abbreviated that it just left a lot to be desired I dont know why with all the effort they put into the game that it would be so hard to give us a like a two minute animated ending or sowasnt this part of why Studio Ghibli was on board in the first placeNow none of these things really detract from the game overall but they are annoyances you will have to deal with when playing this game Overall this game is still every bit as charming refreshing and fun as all the other reviews say they are Here are two positives I absolutely loved about the game The best part about this game is it brings back the world map and exploration to RPGs something that too many new RPGs take for granted these days many are so linear they feel like youre playing CandyLand proceeding from point A to point B along a single path without a choice This game has an actual world map tons of hidden areas and treasures many sidequests and distractions and it is something that feels so refreshing since it is so rare these days to find a RPG with these elements still intact The attention to detail here is very stunning which is why I dont understand how the flaws Ive listed above could happen when you visit the winter isles your characters actually start shivering in the snow Your characters are eventually given snow clothes and those snow clothes appear when you fight in snowy areaseven your profile picture next to your HPMP bars are updated with the new graphics It is easy to skimp on things like this in a game and no one would probably notice it But I for one found this to be yet another refreshing and beautiful aspect of the game and that is what makes a good game greatI sincerely hope that Studio Ghibli does another RPG in the future hopefully with these issues fixed This game has restored my faith that the classic JRPGs of the past are not dead and when done correctly can still be a masterpiece of a game Newer style RPGs have its place and are fun but to play this game in this day and age reminds me of why I bought my PS3 and why I fell in love with video games in the first place,5.0,A number of annoying flawsbut still wonderful,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",3

AA98O5326L88T,B002FQM5B4,Aaron Silverman DJ Kuul A,"[1, 1]",These drums work very well although at this price level its not unreasonable to expect perfection  There are a couple of things that could have been betterFirst the good points  The whole thing is very sturdy especially the foot pedal which is heavy and solid  I havent noticed any missed notes  Also once the pads are tightened properly they dont move  The angle of each pad is adjustable with no form of tightening but they remained firm during play  They stayed in place even through game sessions lasting over 3 hours  The Dpad and controller buttons on the transmitter were a nice useful touch  I had a lot of fun playing theseThere are a few things that could have been better  The most important is the sets very limited adjustability  its not wide enough to move the pads much at all  You cant slide them more than a centimeter or so apart from each other  Theres a little more play in the cymbals but still not a lot and you can forget trying to mount them outside the pads  You can see what I mean by looking at the photos  Also while the leg height is adjustable it doesnt go very high  I am exactly 6 feet tall and at maximum height the pads were just high enough to be comfortable  If youre much taller than that you might want to try before you buy  For what its worth I dont know whether the other available drum kits can be raised any higher than this oneThe other negatives dont really affect play  First folding and unfolding the set is NOT a job measured in seconds  Itll take a few minutes and to really make it flat youll need to remove the cymbals entirely  Not a huge issue but the manufacturers claim is misleading  On a related note the rotating legs have no lock  they just swing freely  I didnt experience any shifting during play but if someone were to bump into the side of the set it could very easily fall over  Just something to be careful of especially if you have small children running around  Another annoyance is the USB dongle  for this kind of money why no bluetooth  Ive heard that the bluetooth system is simply not capable of the exact timing required for music games but I cant say for sure  If true then thats certainly a reasonable excuse  As for the wires that connect the pads and pedal to the transmitter they are plenty long enough but theyre also extremely thin  Im a little afraid that it I were to pick up the set without remembering to also pick up the pedal the weight of the pedal could damage its wire  Something else to watch out for if little kids are in the houseOne more thing to bear in mind is that while the pads dont make a ton of noise they arent exactly quiet  Youll want to turn up the game volume fairly high to drown them out  I was able to play them without waking sleeping people in another room but if you live in a very small place or if you have downstairs neighbors you may be limited in terms of when you can playOverall the good definitely outweighs the bad and I recommend this set if it fits your budget  Ill finish by commenting on its compatibility with the games that I tried Guitar Hero 5  Worked perfectly Rock Band 2  Worked perfectly Rock Revolution  Worked perfectly with the game options set to 5pad mode instead of 7pad mode Rock Band 1  Did not work  was recognized as a microphone by the game  for 5 you can download the songs to Rock Band 2 which I expect would make them playable Rock Band ACDC Track Pack  Did not work  was recognized as a microphone as with RB1 you can download the songs into RB1 or RB2 for free and I expect that the songs would work in RB2,4.0,A very solid kit,1256083200,"10 21, 2009",3

A3SMO4R9IN85NX,B00BQI3UQG,JoshJosh,"[5, 6]",Donkey Kong Country Returns made by Retro Studios Metroid Prime is one of the best games of the past five years It might be the best game on Wii The level design is topnotch turning the game into one that plays how a platformer would play today were the genre to have kept evolving instead of being dumped aside for 3D games It looks great has tons of content and plays extraordinarily well The feel of Donkey and Diddy Kong was perfect The only noticeable flaw was the control  Retro put some moves on a shaking mechanic that while not a dealbreaker was just a bit too imprecise for what the game demandedNintendo has seen fit to move the game over to 3DS and its a good move This is easily one of the best games on the 3DS and easily tops New Super Mario Bros 2 The Wii versions best qualities shine through The level design and character physics are as good as ever  The graphics still look great albeit with some downgrades The frame rate is mostly good although there is noticeable stuttering on busy scenes Its not enough to really affect the flow of the game but it is noticeable All the levels arrive complete with time trials sadly there do not seem to be leaderboards which is a noticeable omissionThe controls ditch the shaking and instead rely on a more typical buttonbased configuration Unfortunately its still not perfect You can use either the dpad or the analog slider but for some reason each is tied to a certain button configuration For example the analog slider mode uses the LR button as grab which doesnt feel entirely natural The dpad button configuration is superior but the low placement of the 3DS dpad makes it a bit awkward to play with I would have greatly appreciated a freeform configuration that would let me set any actions to any buttonsTheres also an new mode which gives the characters a bit more health and offers some items to make it through tricky spots You pick the mode at the beginning of the game and cant switch after I havent tried it instead opting for the Wii mode I am pleased to say the game remains as challenging as it was on Wii  its a great challengeI gave this game five stars on fun  I love this game to bits Retro made a masterpiece of 2D gaming here Overall though Id give the 3DS port four stars Its an amazing game but the lack of control configurations and slight framerate drops take it down a peg Still its a game that MUST MUST MUST be played by anyone who enjoys 2D gaming Even with those slight issues the 3DS version is excellent and well worth playing,4.0,great game good port,1369353600,"05 24, 2013",3

A3VBVORJ38FPOU,B000FKBCX4,Matt,"[32, 149]",Well I figured this game could use a review from someone who has actually played quite a bit through it  Unlike all the other reviews on here from people who have either A not played it B are complaining about SecuRom or C have only played it for 5 minutes and then prepared their review  Anyway the game itself is actually quite fun  You start off in the ocean with whichever little critter you make and swim around and eat smaller fish  Pretty simple and Im sure youve all played a game like that before  Anyway you get bigger and eat bigger fish get some new parts you can add to the species youre creating and voila  After the cell stage you move on to the next stage  Depending on what decisions you made in the cell stage you might be classified as a carnivore herbivore or omnivore  Anyway now youre going to get to add some new things to your species  Add a couple legs arms bigger mouth etc  And remove things you no longer need since youre out of the water  Now you go around and you can either befriend other species or kill them off your choice  I chose to kill most of them off though I tried to befriend them first  Some are very easy to befriend some not so much  One of the things I kept getting is species that wanted me to pose for them but I hadnt found the right parts around the planet yet to give me that ability  In fact didnt find them until right after that stage  This is really an easy stage once you get going  Youll hibernate a couple times to new nests and find some more species to either befriend or make extinct  Most of the new parts you get for your species are by going around the planet and finding bones  Very easy and some are clumped like 56 in one area  Makes for alot of addons for your species  After you finish this stage youll move on to the tribal stage  This stage is kind of like command and conquer style for those of you that have played it  Youre going to be controlling your species from a birdseye view default view you can move the camera though and interact with other tribes  Your species now have the ability to make fire build huts collect food to keep at the camp etc however its pretty much the same basis as the Creature Stage  Just go around and either kill off other tribes or befriend them  The way you played the previous stage also has an affect on this one  Itll classify you as an aggressive species friendly species or adaptable species  Aggressive of course being one that likes to kill species off and friendly one that likes to befriend with adaptable being in the middle  You will start off with 3 creatures from your species in your camp one being the chief and two being workersfighters whatever that may be  You can then add members by creating babies though you can only have a maximum of 6 tribe members until you kill off other tribes to increase your amount  I havent finished this stage yet but its pretty good  Believe there are two more stages after this and Ill try and edit my review when I find out  I myself dont really think this game has to much replayability  Sure you can create new creatures and all but the only difference will really be changing to a herbivore or something  It would be stupid not to say that every time you make a new creature you are going to give it the same parts as your previous as youll want the best stats  Though you can form it in different ways it will always kind of look alike  Another thing I dislike is the fact you can change your character so much  They dont limit the customization at all  Im not talking about the first time but once youve looked like lets say a dinosaur the next time youre in edit mode you can make some kind of 10 legged species with 15 eyes wings completely change the color take away the tail and though if thats what the player wants to do I guess thats fine but its just weird  My species actually went from looking like a horse to looking like a TRex of course I guess that was my own fault but still  Anyway still a pretty decent game though I might be biased as I had no idea this game was in the works for the last 10 years or whatever  I just heard about it like two or three weeks ago I think when they released Spore Origins on iTunes and I wanted to check it out so I wasnt expecting a genrechanging game like most people  Now about Securomit really sucks yeah but I guess we have to live with it or just stay away until they are forced to change it  I actually install any securom games on my computer that isnt connected to internet and if I have to connect it for activation I do and then disconnect it again  Still a pretty good computer and I dont use it for anything else because I have this computer  I myself got the game for about 38 because my friend got it for 25 where he works so thats probably another reason I gave it a try  Its not the greatest game ever made but its not that bad either  For all the hype Ive heard and read that this game has had I would be pretty mad to if this was what I ended up getting but as I said I had no expectations so it was fine with me  I know my opinion would be different if I had been waiting 10 years for it,4.0,A review for someone that has ACTUALLY played the game THOUROUGLY,1220745600,"09 7, 2008",3

A17WUZZ6RPK117,B00026ENLE,Andrew Fredrickson,"[4, 4]",Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle Earth is a brand new strategy game from EA based on the movie trilogy The presentation of the game is excellent new voice work from Ian McKellan Gandalf gives the game a tone from the other movies and does it very well The game gives a single player mode as either the good or evil forces online  LAN multiplayer options and offline skirmish gamesThe four races or armies in the game represent the factions from the movies Gondor Rohan Isengard  Mordor Each race has some similar units such as archers foot soldiers siege weapons etc Though one thing i didnt like about this was how some armies have nearly three times as many units as the other for example Rohan the entire army selection wout the heroes more on that in a bit is 4 units Peasents Rohan horseback warriors Rohan Archers and Archer horsebacks This can leave some serious imbalence issues with online games and such hardley any defense from siege no options from foot soliders it just seems EA could have added a few more units though perhaps EA was trying to match all the units to the counterparts in the movie The more balenced armies are Gondor  Mordor Isengard still needs some work in my opinionThe newest addition to the game is the heroes they compose of the main characters from the trilogy ie Gandalf Frodo Aragorn Gimli Legolas etc As they fight in battle they gain experience which makes them become more powerful and gain more abilities to turn the tide of battle similar to the Warcraft 3 hero setup Heroes just have a health bar no mana or anything like that powers are activated and recharge over timeOne thing in the campaign side of the game as units and heroes gain experience that carries over to the next mission so eventually your level one archer can become so incredibly powerful that they can take down the bigger units like Nazgul Mumakil the giant elephantlike creatures in ROTK Cave Trolls etc It just seems that the game can become too easy in the end without giving a huge challenge Though one feature I do like is when you fight and kill units you gain power points this grants you access to the huge Power Tree for example after 20 minutes of play Ive gained about 8 points i can spend it on a healing spell summon reinforcements life Elven Archers Rohan Warrios Mordor Orcs etc As you gain more and more ponts you gain better powers like summoning Ents extra resources and the big powers like summoning a Balrog or the Army of the Dead which cause incredible damage to everything in its pathI also like the base system once your forces conquer a piece of land you can choose to place a plot a plot give you the main building which you must keep alive usually called the Citidal and about 68 open plots which can be used for barracks for units resource farms guard towers and special unit bonus buildings Thus you must choose carefully what you want in your base and as you explore the map you can find more outposts which gives a Citidal  3 plots Resources are automatically gathered nad the more of one building you have you usually gain cost reduction bonuses for units upgrades etc The only other big change i would have liked the game go to with more a of hybrid of Rome Total War  Warcraft 3 gameplay bigger battles was what I was expecting from the screenshots Ive seens but the games works fine just like thisNow that Ive explained most of the game Ill do a rundown of how the game performsGraphics youll need a pretty decent rig to run this at full options my computer consists ofP4 32 ghz1 gig of RAMATI Raedon 9600 XTI was able to run the game at full settings a decent computer would be around1626 ghz5121 gig of RAMATI 9200  or nVidia 5600 video cardGraphics are great for this game the game uses the Conmand  Conquer Generals engine which is still quite impressive to this day Fluid animations good detail for individual units great job aroundSound Score from the movies  some cheesy voice work from the voices of the untisControls Easy as pie if youve played RTS games before youll have no trouble getting into this oneOverall the game represents the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy as a great whole From RTS veterans such as myself to complete newbies in a good way this is worth your money excellent game for the LOTR fanatic,4.0,Despite some short comings this is a worthy LOTR game,1102982400,"12 14, 2004",3

A2WGXE8JPTWYUL,B007WQOIGW,Michael Austerlitz,"[1, 3]",Let me start by saying Ive read all the comics seen every episode of the TV show and am a huge fan of The Walking Dead series both in written and visual formThis game blew me away Its storytelling tactics are insanely original the characters are beautifully craftedand it truly feels like a gaming experience not just a game itselfIll lay out the pros and cons of the gameProsGreat story I literally almost cried at the endAmazing characters Each character has a beautifully crafted arc and you really become Lee Everett in the gameGraphics are well done Although a bit laggy the graphics are fun and interestingAlways surprises I feel like the comics sometimes draw certain stories out too much and the show definitely does that part 1 of season 2 for example I never felt that in the gameConsControls This isnt an FPS nor is it an actionadventure game like Batman Arkham City for example Its a point and click for action type game But even then I found it hard to point and click at the right moments due to poor button configurationLagging The graphics tended to be blotchy and buggy a lot of the time during cutscenes and sometimes during the game But this didnt take away from the overall experience of the gameLike I said This isnt the best game Ive ever played but its the best experience Ive had Never have I invested so much into a character or characters into a story or a video game world  You become the characters you play and you definitely build relationships Its fun exciting tearjerking sometimes annoying but believe me You do not want to miss out on playing this Itll take 15 hours of your time max and every second is worth it except those seconds where youre walking back and forth trying to find an appliance to open a door,5.0,Best gaming EXPERIENCE Ive ever had,1356480000,"12 26, 2012",3

A2B40ERM3QI6E,B001AWBYNE,Campy,"[3, 4]",So I finally got to play the three modes this game has to offer and since it had been a hot issue whether this game was just CoD 4 on WWII wheels I think some things needed to be cleared up Graphics this game doesnt look much better or detailed than CoD4 The difference Much fancier settings lead to seemingly better graphics CoD 4 took place in very droll settings modern day terrorists should get interior decorators for reals but the fact of the matter is they look practically the same Thats a no no for WW cos they could have at least improved a bit The water in case you were wondering looks good enough to drink get some type of poisoning for drinking water where rats pee and then die drowning in your own pool of vomit and bile right by the good looking water since water and face movements are two watermarks for how good graphics areSound the guns sound amazingin the sense that most WWII weapons sounded like pop guns in comparison to modern guns The voice acting is really really good Like really The music in the Pacific Theater levels SUCKS It actually sucks so much its overshadowing a very nice game Its a faux pas comparable to using Godsmack for PoP Warrior Within I dunno who Sean Murray is but dude you is the suckzors On the other hand Mr Lost Boys himelf as CplthenSgt Roebuck is EXCELLENT And not to be left behind by Gary Oldman as Reznov who for any of you who saw Enemy at the Gates should have been called Koulikov but I guess they would have suedGameplay Oooh ok the nitty gritty This game has way moreumquirks than CoD4 Collectibles and um modes and stuff So if thats your tea in a cup goodly  But this game does not feel as tight as CoD4 The sloppiness isnt so bad that it detracts from gameplay but it is noticeable Right from the start It doesnt help either that more often than not theres a variety of paths to take not that the game is not linear it is just its up to you whether or not you want to take it up through the trench or whether you want to slap the bullseye on your helmet and go over the top But for the most part ahem yes this is CoD 4 on WWII wheels To me though thats not bad Is it worth shelling over 60 At first I thought no but theres the issue of different game modesSingle campaign solo This game suffers greatly from uneven level design Let me specifythe game unlike CoD4 doesnt follow a cohesive storylinethe problem lies in the fact that youre not pursuing two terrorists who have one common endgameno youre fighting the whole axisso when you take that from macro to micro it suffers and the levels seem tacked on Truth be told every level feels separate from the next Which in retrospective makes CoD4s SP truly shine because it now seems like a great movie WW just seems like random WWII encounters put together I LOVE WII so thats not a problem for me but it might be for you Now the meat and potatoesCompetitive MP well I am WOWED It is very much so like CoD 4 but before you start complaining think about it whats bad about that And what Ive been hearing is true Power Housing in this game is way more difficult as is campingbecause its easy to catch a camper sitting on his arse from behind The level designs were thought in a more organic way I think War ravaged buildings outlandish situations Another very interesting byproduct of this being a WWII is the weapons  You might say huh Well WWII shooters have WWII guns What does that mean Well by modernday guns standards a lot of the weapons used in WWII are underpowered A few exceptions aside  the weaknesses of WWII guns have been implemented in a way that it hinders you like it would in real life something that wasnt really present in CoD4 because modern day guns are a progression of improvement in weaponry The MP5 for example is a powerhouse because heck its a frickin state of the art gun But for example take the beloved M1 Garand Its powerful and it is precise And you have to have a happy trigger finger to have a good repeat on it And you have to take a frickin clip out and it goes ping when youre out and thats gonna be every 8 shots Shoot Another example  The BAR Ooooh chills Well its slow going and the clip is a measly 20 bullets Shall we talk about bolt action rifles Shoot bolt shoot bolt five bullets and megalong reload Oh noes Also the grenades werent as powerful as they are now and Tater Mashers are sort of a joke unless you have the aim of William Tell  So I think for now since Im still starting the gameplay has been kept level with the guns as well Now the pleasant surpriseCoop MP Well I played with a friend and WOW we kept dying and coming back laughing Talk about team work being important Its similar to R2s coop but there are no classes so every character is on the level and every player can take care of their buddies with careful planning But I gotta say and hey we only played about two levels my friend and I  but this mode made me say well Im glad I didnt wait until it got down to 40 Really I mean this mode of play overshadows the SP greatly for the single fact that its the same thing just multiplayerSo these issues taken into account I still dont know if we could cut Treyarch some slack or notthey say plagiarism is the best form of compliment These guys might not be the best developers around and they are not far from being the worst from what I hear  I never played CoD3 but they sure know how to identify the features that make a good game and putting them togetherAs a sidenote the first level you play as a Soviet is a dead ringer for the initial scenes from Enemy at the Gates which had been somewhat depicted in CoD but it didnt matter much to me it was incredibly fun Old timey sniping was good timey snipingBtw

A20FR2NG18QAKX,B002I096AA,Albert Thompson Sharkface,"[5, 7]",Alright so the time has come and the 3DS is finally upon us Ive had mine since launch day Actually got it early but whos counting and I have had time to feel out the system Now at a first glance one might ask themselves Why buy a 3DS A DS came out just last year Come on Nintendo And you are right to an extent While the dawning of the DSi XL was rather recent it really cant be considered a legitimate new hardware Hell Id not even consider the DSi originally to be much of a new innovative thingClever marketing as it may be Nintendo didnt just rehash a system this time For those of you saying what you will about the 3D effect honestly it can go either way The 3D did not make the system for me Though it may be the titles standing point it was not the reason whatsoever that I purchased this new hardware I personally hate 3D and think its an awful gimmick And while the 3D effect is cool and somewhat a nice example of the technology its simply not enough to validate purchasing the system especially due to the incredible headaches it has provoked on to me in a good 15 minutes of menu sorting  What else is there to say Well the overall make of the game is rather nice It seems solid well built and everything just feels like it works rather well Wireless switch where the power switch once was a collapsing stylus a nice touch sensitive screen It all is worthy of the 250 you spend The buttons click as you press them not to the point where resistance will stop you from punching fast enough but to the point where you know they are working In addition and probably my favorite new thing we have a little thumbstick How lovely It makes moving around in certain games feel so much more natural And it really does help with fighting games so far My only gripe with the hardware itself is that they glossed it GLOSS IS MY ULTIMATE FOE It picks up fingerprints rather easily to the point where I dont like playing it unless I washed my hands first and I do a lot having a touch screen phone and the second problem is turning it off Now itd be nice to hold the power button a sec and turn it off but this thing seems to take a while to power down It sort of worries me I also have had a few times where in the midst of a game it gave me an unknown error and forced me to hard restart the system I hope this is patched The battery life is shallow but one should really limit how much they play outside their home It comes with a little charging base too which seems poorly constructed but does its job DAMN well Every night I drop it in the cradle and go to sleep Next day I take it with me get my daily coins for walking with it and sometimes play a few games when Im sitting idly I am enjoying the hardware And the pedometer really gives you that extra incentive to take it with you wherever you go not to mention streetpass Though Ive sadly come in contact with nobody that have another 3DS since I bought this thing Haha Hopefully Otakon will change that this year DThere are camera abilities just as the DSi originally had With games like Faceraiders and the AR card functions theres some neat little minigames and applications you can use to get people around you going Wow though I wouldnt consider it a real selling point The photos often show up rather blurry and pixelated though I dont think this system is an intended digital cameraSo 250 dollars Not bad at all Consider the previous prices for handhelds and I think its a valid price for something that packs such a punch I see serious potential in this system The lineup at the present moment is incredibly dull and shallow but I am hoping and praying and am anticipating that Nintendo wont let this system fail Having picked up games like Street Fighter Ghost Recon Dead or Alive Splinter Cell and more it would seem Nintendo is having no problem finding beefy franchises to boast their new technology withOverall I am here to talk about the system itself And as of right now sure the game lineup sucks but the system has the ability and already is showing great examples of the power it holds and the potential waiting to be unlocked A cheap price a great entertainment source in the works and an overall conversation starter among groups everywhere Yes I think the 3DS is here to stay for a bit,4.0,Nothing is ever quite perfect,1302480000,"04 11, 2011",3

AWGPEXO9M8R7Q,B003O6JIVE,Stephen M Sturgeon,"[9, 10]",Let me start by saying that I actually liked the original FF XIII I know a lot of people didnt and I can understand why XIII had its strengths but it also had its weaknesses to the point where I was honestly surprised when they announced a sequelBut as many problems as XIII had XIII2 addresses these problems and came up as the game that the original XIII should have beenIts no longer a corridor crawl While each area has an objective and a map leading you to that objective youre not shoehorned into going where the game wants you to go You have room to explore and do side quests So the linearity and lack of towns is very much improved with thisThe battles are a mixed bag Its a little different engaging your enemy Its a mix between having creatures pop up on the world map then having a limited time to either engage or flee The actual battles themselves are similar enough to XIII that you could go straight from the old game to this one and feel right at homeBoss battles however now include a new feature thats pretty much the same quick time events that you see in other games However it gives you ample warning that an event is coming up the time to react is very generous and it doesnt end in a game over if you mess up You simply dont end the battle as well as you could which may mean missing out on some enemy drops or a slight change in story lineIm rather split on this As far as quick time events go XIII2 does this very well but Im not used to having this kind of play mechanic in a JRPG It could be a take it or leave itSo heres what XIII2 did right They refined the battle system added towns and opened up the exploration This does everything XIII tried to do only better This is the game XIII was trying to be In this way it is a very good game and well worth your moneyHeres what XIII2 did wrong It is a very short game Just looking at the calendar it was released on Jan 31 I just beat it yesterday Eight days I beat this game in eight days I have NEVER beaten an RPG let alone a Final Fantasy game in eight days Sure theres still plenty of side quests to do Theres plenty of content that offsets the shortness of the main quest But the main quest is the real meat ofand the main reason to buya JRPG It should never be so short particularly a Final Fantasy gameAlso the ending Yes do let me rant awhile Without spoiling too much its a bit of a downer ending That I can handle Crisis Core had a downer ending Tomb Raider Last Revelation had a downer ending Hamlet had a downer ending I can handle downer endingsWhat I dont like are three little words to be continued When you spend premium prices on a game you shouldnt have to proceed to be nickel and dimed by downloadable content to get the real ending Actually I wouldnt even be so harsh about to be continued as long as the game itself had a selfcontained ending an ending that would make you say yeah theres more to see I may get the next part to see how it resolves But I feel satisfied with this If this is all I see of this story line I still feel like I had a complete story and therefore a complete experienceBut thats not what they do The ending leaves everything in a very bad very unresolved way They let you know that if you want any kind of resolution youre going to have to pay more above and beyond the not so cheap sticker priceNow dont get me wrong I think downloadable content has its place an outfit a special weapon new characters new maps But to make a precedent where you have to download the actual ending to the game above and beyond the sticker price is the start of a slippery slope of not having to have an entire game on a rather expensive disk dolling out the rest of the game in an undetermined number of expansions that nickel and dime the players who already paid to be able to play AND FINISH the gameSo where does that leave this review Does the good outweigh the badUnfortunately yes The good does outweigh the bad Like I said at the beginning of this review I liked the original XIII This does everything better Its what XIII should have been I may or may not go for the DLC that finishes out the game though Ill be a sucker if I do But the bottom line is that this game is fun It has an emotional impact with the story You come to care about the characters Its a heck of a journeyI would give this game five stars even given the shortness of the main quest The ending and having to go to DLC in order to finish the game however is going to cost it a starIts a dangerous precedent of not having an entire game on the disk and forcing the players into downloading more DLC in order to have a complete experience Video games are an expensive hobby enough without being nickel and dimed just to get a complete gameI would say three and a half stars Amazon doesnt deal in half stars Since everything else about the game is so good Ill be generous and say four stars,4.0,Great game then theres the ending,1328745600,"02 9, 2012",3

A1B4VTD0FVD6OV,B00008I800,DGM,"[0, 0]",Believe it or not this game is sort of a movie tiein The story supposedly takes place after the first Hulk movie with Eric Bana which was a very lackluster film Fortunately this game makes things much more interesting by blending elements of the movie with those of the comic books More specifically many characters from the comics like the Leader Betty Ross and other more obscure Hulk enemies like Ravage Flux Madman and HalfLife appear as well In this game Bruce is looking for a way to cure himself of the Hulk but in the process a supposed doctor friend of his absorbs some of Bruces radiation and turns himself into his own version of the Hulk naming himself Ravage The Hulk then goes after Ravage in the hopes of stopping him and the Leader from using his own radiation to create an army of Hulks So the story is pretty good and the gameplay is thankfully even better Even though this is not a freeroaming game its still plenty fun going through the many levels mostly underground or military bases and beating the crap out of soldiers tanks Hulkbuster robots gamma dogs like in the movie and gamma soldiers The gamma soldiers can actually be quite annoying with their martial arts attacks and theyre twice as annoying when theyre armed with gamma blasters that do an insane amount of damage to the Hulk The boss fights are also quite challenging and several of them require more than simply running up to the boss and continually smacking them around For example getting close to HalfLife allows him to absorb the Hulks health while increasing his own so keeping him at bay by throwing crates and pipes at him is the way to go for that battleThe Hulk himself controls well and can perform damaging grapple attacks on his enemies like breaking their backs or throwing them into other enemies His standard punching smashing and thunderclap attacks can get the job done most of the time but he can also perform powerful rage attacks that can take out large groups of enemies simultaneously with either a super ground smash or super thunder clap The one downside gameplaywise are the levels where you play as Bruce Banner which involve him sneaking through certain areas in order to reach his destination Bruce has limited combat capabilities which can work against weaker enemies who dont have firearms but against armed enemies not to mention gamma dogs and soldiers Bruce will get killed in seconds So stealth is the name of the game while playing as Bruce and while the stealth itself isnt bad it seems a little out of place with this particular type of game The hacking portions of these stealth playthroughs are especially annoying could have done without those For its time especially this game looks pretty good with its celshaded graphics and the sound of all the explosions energy blasts and the Hulks roaring and poundings are well done All in all this game is good for Hulk fans to buy especially at its current price and its plenty challenging and fun,4.0,Overall a very decent Hulk game,1299888000,"03 12, 2011",3

AWT53A209LVQ0,B0002CHJA0,Ian Watts,"[2, 2]",I havent completed the singleplayer campaign for Ghost Recon 2 but I thought I would go ahead and offer my impressions nonetheless  First off the Tom Clancy games are my favorite Xbox franchise after Halo and I loved the first Ghost Recon and the Island Thunder expansion pack despite their flaws so when I first heard about Ghost Recon 2 I was pretty excited about seeing the final product  Now that Ive played the actual game for a while I cant help but agree with other reviewers here who say that although Ghost Recon 2 may very well be a good game it really isnt Ghost Recon  Despite their occasionally rough graphics and overcomplicated controls I ultimately think that GR and GRIT were more unique and enjoyable than GR2  I must give Ubisoft credit for being willing to go in a new direction with the sequel to one of their most popular games instead of simply tweaking the graphics a little and adding a new feature here or there EA anyone  Didnt like the fixed first person perspective of the first game  Well now you can switch between first person and an over the shoulder view  Thought the menus were confusing  Now theyve been simplified and the selection of weapons streamlined  Thought the command system for managing your squad was too complicated  Now you just have one squad to worry about and the command system more closely resembles Rainbow 6 than the original Ghost Recon  In fact the whole game seems much closer to Rainbow 6 than the first Ghost Recon and therein lies much of the problem I think  Yes GR1 was a little complicated but once you did master it you had a wealth of options available to you in terms of both strategy and tactics  GR2 is much more like a typical runandgun shooter in which you have a squad who backs you up in other words Rainbow 6  Having one squad isnt too much of a problem for me as I often went out with one in the first game to simplify matters but the ability to switch between characters is sorely lacking  In the first game you could be the sniper whenever that was necessary or switch to the guy with an automatic weapon whenever you needed to hose down a building full of enemies but now you simply command your squadmates to do those things for you  Ubisoft has also apparently eliminated indoor environments  This is understandable given that the squads would often get stuck in doorways and such whenever you went inside a building in the first game but I think they could have just fixed that problem instead of simply getting rid of what was an interesting element of gameplay  The AI is also a little different the North Koreans seem more adept at taking cover and protecting themselves than the Russians or Cubans did in GR and GRIT but their heightened aggression comes at a price  In the first game the enemies basically patrolled a certain number of paths which allowed you to observe them and then decide how to best attack them at your leisure  In GR2 they simply spawn when you reach certain points at the game and attack you en masse  Much of the stealth and strategy elements that distinguished the first game and its expansion packs are simply gone  In its place you have a wellpolished and nicely executed military shooter that bears little resemblance to its predecessors and is best enjoyed without any prior expectations,4.0,Closer to 35 stars overall,1105574400,"01 13, 2005",3

shallow bad combat overrated etc the usual things the second guessers say about a well received gameI picked up a copy of the game for myself and have now beaten it and unlocked 94 of the achievements the most I have ever done in a game before  My in depth experience has given me an informed impression of the game  There is much this game does right where it will just grab you then hold you in the palm of its hand  At other times you may find yourself annoyed frustrated or even bored  All in all this is an excellent game that you should experience but UBI Soft had a particular type of gamer in mind when they designed this new Prince of PersiaLet me start with why you should get this gameFor one the game is absolutely gorgeous A work of Art I love the look of this game and it is nice to see a Western developer create a style so detailed and beautiful I cant stand the big eyed weird looking Japanese style of artistic games and I hope other Western devs follow Ubi Softs lead It is part cel shaded part conventional graphics reminds me of a movie which uses Rotoscope animation The game world is like a painting in a museum and the main characters have so much detail and care put into their design and every movement you cant help but take notice even when in an intense situation This is the type of game you stop playing for a bit and just look at Having the Prince stand on a balcony of a massive tower overlooking a massive landscape is a sight to behold My dream game would be a Conan game which uses Ubi Softs engine and Frank Frazettas art styleThe difficulty in this game is about the same as Sands of Time and may even be a tick more challenging No you cant die in the game the AI character will always save you It is a bit lame but it is not much different than using the time control in Sands of Time to rewind time to save yourself It is essentially the same concept I dont see why some are so hard on this game but give Sands of Time a pass Also there are a ton of games which allow you to save anywhere at anytime creating your own checkpoints How is that any less cheap than not dying in this game There is also an achievement you can get where the AI can not save you more than 100 times theres a little incentive for you to be more careful And there is another component to this game which involves collecting light cystals after you beat certain areas It can be pretty damn tough to get all of them and offers a different kind of challengeAlot of games these days are short Too short Prince of Persia is not one of those games though Yes once you do beat it you may be done with it but it is like that with most single player games  It took me well over 12 hours to beat this game  Now alot of my time had been spent gawking at the scenery but this isnt a game meant to be rushed through You really have to stop once in a while and soak it all inThe gameplay is very good and the controls are top notch This is an action platformer and a joy to play  There are plenty of intense and epic moments to be had in this game you constantly be wondering what else they have in store for you The gameplay is like Sands of Time but with a slightly faster pace and more intuitive controlsThe combat is pretty good This is not Warrior Within so there arent that many enemies to do battle with The focus is platforming and exploration here What combat there is though is pretty fun A more polished version of Sands of Time where you can do some really cool stuff  The gripe I have about the combat are the Flash Prompts which I will discuss laterThe sound in this game is incredible From the effects to the music It doesnt just sound good but it knows the right time to kick in as well Youll hear an earth shattering roar just when things started to get nice and quiet or youll hear some epic movie like music just as you walk out onto that balcony to check out the scenery Like Luke Skywalker watching the Tatooine Suns set with a John Williams score in the backgroundYes there are some flaws and Ill mention them real quickThe Prince himself can be annoying UBI Soft has such an incredible art style and gorgeous game world they should have taken the character more seriously They went in a tongue in cheek direction but only with the Prince character They tried to make him sarcastic and witty but he comes across as a bad Disney version of Han Solo or a poor mans Ash Bruce Campbell in Evil Dead Movies It does take away from the game quite a bit at first but eventually he will either grow on you or youll learn to tolerate himThe story is generic Would have been nice to have a story that matched the scale of the game world But it is nothing too bad especially by Video Game standards  The ending I must say redeems the story completely and leaves you gaping at your screen  ExceptionalCollecting the light seeds will seem tedious at first it did to me But then I realized the real challenge in getting to some of these things and how it adds a new dimension to the gameplay I soon looked forward to collecting them  But they will be tedious to othersThe game has incredible platform elements Im talking some pretty intense stuff here but the platform puzzle aspect other than getting to some of the light seeds is lacking One main reason for this is you can have your AI companion cast a spell which lights up the path you need to take A glowing orb will show you the direction if you press the Y button Still getting through that path safely can be quite a challenge and when it comes to finding a way to get to light seeds youre on your own Some Tomb Raider like puzzles would have been great and would have added much to the gameplayThe game world feels a little lonely not that many characters You are basically trying to save an abandoned part of the world so its mostly just you and the AI Companion along with the occasional enemy to battle Would have been awesome if this game had a Zelda like spin to it A minor gripeThe bosses are pretty impressive in the game but you dont have any real fear of dying from them  Youll be amazed what you live through The fights themselves can be quite the spectacle a spectacle you are fully involved in  But the battles also use what I will call flash prompts where the bad guy gets close and enters an animation and you cant control your because youre supposed to wait for the appropriate button to fash on the screen and if you hit it in time the Prince will react and counter but if you miss it you get to watch him get beat on  These flash prompts were a pain to me I felt detached from the experience  They arent a huge portion of the battle experience thoughFinal ThoughtsPrince of Persia was designed with a more casual gamer in mind  Someone who is not particularly seasoned in gaming but is interested in getting lost in a beautiful new world  Somneone who enjoys games but does not have the time to sink endless hours into one and accomplish nothing  The objectives of the game are the same throughout beat a world which takes around 20 mins or so and then collect the needed light seeds  It is the type of game best enjoyed when played in spurts as opposed to setting aside your whole weekend afternoon  The longer you play it the more tedious the limited battles and light seed collecting becomes  When you play it in spurts such as an hour or maybe two at a time then you will be presented with a gorgeous and fully detailed world lifted right out of the dreams of your childhood and the pages of a Fairy Tale  The platforming and acrobatic moves are a joy and collecting all the light seeds in an area is a challenge but one that wont keep you up all night  The gameplay is incredibly streamlined and there is a deliberate effort to avoid frustration as much as possible  This is good for those who play it in spurts but possibly problematic for those who grind right through every game they get  With the beautiful animations Ubi Soft is also flirting with some dangerous territory here where you feel you are watching the game more than playing the game  Still quite challenging but at times the platforming seems a little too automated as wellIt is a beautiful elegant game which controls perfectly and oozes high production value with its top notch presentation  The game is in many ways a work of art  A visual and audio work of art  Story except for the end is rather bland and the gameplay highly streamlined  The game does hold your hand more than many would like but the critics of Prince of Persia are exaggerating quite a bit when it comes to this game It is a well made product a work of art and can be tons of fun just play it in spurts and not with a must beat it mindset  Sit back and soak it all in youll be glad you didMy Letter Grade for Prince of Persia would be a B,4.0,When a Game becomes Art,1230163200,"12 25, 2008",3

A3W3LP0RSWLJCS,B003O6G5TW,Annihilatrix1138,"[2, 3]",I got a lot of mileage out ofBATTLEFIELD BAD COMPANY 2 While the campaign was pretty much a bust I was still having fun with its multiplayer mode until only a few weeks ago  when it was time to start bracing for this game It was the most fun Id had with an FPS since the original BATTLEFIELD 1942 another game that wasnt necessarily all about having an itchy trigger finger but whether or not you could work together with your team to complete an objective BATTLEFIELD 3 continues that tradition of addicting teambased gameplay again delivering one of the finest multiplayer modes Ive ever playedBut in its mad rush to dethrone the CALL OF DUTY franchise the developers over at DICE may have pulled the trigger a bit too early While still a game that holds itself high above all others in the genre it does so weak at the kneesCAMPAIGNAs I said the campaign for BAD COMPANY 2 couldve been better It was pretty and frantic at times but it wasnt very long before it started to feel repetitive You can throw as many enemy soldiers as you want at the player but if theres no substance no reason to even care if youre being shot at then somethings off BATTLEFIELD 3 tries to rectify this by making the missions more involving  mostly through action Its not so much Go Here Kill Them though you will be doing a lot of that but more like Go Here Guess Whats Gonna Happen Next Theres more variety in terms of how each mission is completed For an idea of what I mean it kinda boils down to this If youve played the MODERN WARFARE series well there you goDICE have tried to capture that proverbial CoD lightning in a bottle by delivering a campaign that feels like MODERN WARFARE if it tried to take itself way too seriously and that might be good or bad depending BATTLEFIELD 3 has all the action but a startling lack of characters that exude anything other than military protocol You know that you for the most part play as Staff Sergeant Henry Blackburn the solemn stonefaced US Marine that you see in cutscenes between missions You also know that Blackburn was attempting to stop a nuclear threat of some kind before being placed under interrogation by his superiors Aside from that the eyepopping action and the attention to detail theres not much more to it than thatGranted all of the levels look dazzling and unique from each other Its obvious that A LOT of work went into the level design I cant tell you how many times I found myself holding up the mission just to take in the scenery Its definitely one of the best if not THE best looking games currently available on the Xbox 360 For a game to look this good on sixyearold hardware DICE must have magicians working for themIts definitely the best BATTLEFIELD campaign that Ive played Unlike BC2 I was rarely bored the action is intense there are some interesting twists and turns and the visuals take everything up to a whole other level The main caveat being that its just nothing that hasnt been done before Militarybased shooters involving a nuclear threat are in no short supply these days Add to that your typical launch day glitchesbugs questionable AI and lack of compelling characters to care about and youve got a campaign that wont disappoint but at the same time only raises the bar for its own franchiseThough it does pull off a framed narrative with more competence than DRAGON AGE 2 Ill take any excuse to rail against that gameMULTIPLAYERA majority of BF3s players will very likely forget that theres a campaign disc and throw themselves straight at the multiplayer Almost did that myself To be brief that multiplayer is good Very good I wasnt sure how DICE would improve on BAD COMPANY 2s nearflawless in my opinion multiplayer mode but theyve certainly found a way A lot of the changes are cosmetic The levels are more citybased which adds a whole new element of strategy coming from BC2s mostly rural settingThe destruction aspect is still there Smaller one or two story buildings that take a little bit too much flak will eventually collapse and taller buildings under the same treatment will shed mounds of debris onto the streets below exposing the inner floors and decimating any players unlucky enough to be standing on the wrong part of the sidewalk There was some concern about whether or not the destruction was toned down for BF3 but I dont believe it has theres just different forms of destruction now Youre not going to see towers collapsing onto the streets or anything but like in BC2 the levels probably wont look very pretty by the time your games overThe vehicles are back with the notable addition of the FA 18 Super Hornet enabling jet combat with its own set of weapons and countermeasures New to the series vehicles can now be disabled making it possible for ground troops to get the upper hand with some effort The classes have also been tweaked a bit with Assault now fulfilling the role of Medic as well and the new Support class being for ammo distribution and enemy suppression To top it all off there are many more options for customizing and finetuning your weapon and sidearm to suit your playstyle No colorful weapon skins or anything like that but I consider that a plus in this contextMovement has been improved with the ability to vaultslide over obstacles and the reintroduction of being able to go prone At first I was very much against this since I could envision half the map hiding away prone sniping until they got bored Doesnt mean that didnt happen but the lack of maneuverability you have makes it difficult to defend yourself should you be discovered Keeps things nice and balanced for nowThe current downside to the multiplayer is that its not quite stable Its very clear that EA underestimated just how many people would be playing so lag and entire servers going dark is a constant At this point I havent even been able to access all of the maps yet Its tough for me to complain less than two days after launch since this is usually the case for all games of this type but with the campaign being in the almost state it is now and the rest of the game being so heavily reliant on its online element you might have yourself a two disc game and nothing to doThis should be cleared up and stabilized within the next few weeks along with the battery of patches that are sure to come but if you like having the certainty of playing as you like waiting to pick this game up might be in your best interestAs it stands Ive played through the campaign and seen enough of the multiplayer to know that I wont be regretting this purchase I can nitpick  about this aggravating online pass business the AI teammates that like to push me out of cover or how the only female character in the game is the only one who doesnt talk  but it wouldnt take away from the fact that Ive been having the time of my life when the servers permit it In my mind these nitpicks are what keep BATTLEFIELD 3 from achieving the absolute greatness that I thought it would on its first try but even so its still met my expectations  and its been a great ride so farNow we can all sit back and wait for the inevitable BATTLEFIELD 3 VIETNAM,4.0,Returning to the Field,1319587200,"10 26, 2011",3

AXKOIBI3C9NT2,B0050SXLQC,Matt,"[2, 2]",I knew exactly what I would be getting into with Resident Evil 6 which is why I waited until the game dropped to about 20 on Amazon I actually had no intention of ever playing it but couldnt believe the price I think even disappointing games are worth a 20 bill as long as they are playableThis game is not Resident Evil I know that and you know that Its a thirdperson action shooter that just takes place in the RE universe and utilizes the RE characters They really shouldve just created this game as a totally different IP and put the Resident Evil trademark out to pasture If youre looking for the classic RE experience just give up and go play the earlier games because that experience is never coming backSo how does it fare as an action shooter In my opinion not too well I personally cant stand how close the camera follows your character as heshe will essentially take up half of the screen making it difficult to see where enemies and obstacles are particularly in skinny hallways and small rooms and especially when running With some exceptions the environments are incredibly dark even with the brightness maxed out making it all the more difficult to see what youre supposed to be shooting at Given the outrageous scripted action sequences and active environments theres not a lot of horror to be had here and having to navigate unnecessarily dark rooms is aggravating instead of scary and also led to some serious eyestrainThe aiming mechanics are clunky and it can be very difficult to hit moving enemies most of them are leading to a frustrating waste of ammo which is often surprisingly scarce for an action shooter This can be counteracted however by utilizing a characters melee attack which is almost too effective but its silly to play what is clearly a shooting game and go around throwing elbows all the time You can at least move while aiming and thats a nice feature than any shooter should have however the movement is incredible slow and is not really useful in most situations Your character also has a nasty habit of automatically sticking up next to walls and other forms of standing cover when you get near them while aiming With me this often happened suddenly and unexpectedly right in the middle of a huge firefight leading to frustrating battles with the controller to get my character off the wall and back under controlThe enemies you face this time around are of course zombies and a variety of strange increasingly bizarre mutated things Unfortunately the term zombie is used more for historical effect as the enemies in RE6 are a far cry from what most would consider zombies Zombies now shoot firearms including light machine guns and rocket launchers as well as carry shields and pop in and out of cover How jarringly stupid is that As I mentioned above this is a flagrant reminder that this is not resident evil but just a Call of Dutystyle shooter with a very thin coat of traditional survival horror paint slapped on it Give me a freaking break CapcomAs another slap in the face to survival horror your character now has a constant companion human or AIthat joins you This is of course entirely for the purposes of humanhuman coop gameplay but it makes an already unscary game even less scary I never played with a human teammate so I cant comment on that although i suspect its probably enjoyable but I can easily say that the friendly AI player is incredibly useless They cant seem to hit things a few feet in front of them most times and its not uncommon to see himher go running into and through a room completely ignoring the enemies within only to stop at the exit and wait At least theyre seemingly invincible and you dont have to keep reviving them And on no real surprising note coop events are inanely limited as always to pressing a button to open a door together or pressing a button to boost the other player up to a higher levelThe graphics are nice and pretty but thats about all companies like Capcom and SquareEnix are known for these days The music and sound are fine but nothing to write home about and nothing memorable The voice acting is pretty decent but the dialogue is standard hokey fareThe plot is not noteworty by any means unless you happen to be obsessed with the RE universe and its details I followed along with all of the cutscenes and dialogue throughout the entire game and I remember very little of why I was doing what I was doing Who cares Move from Point A to Point B and shoot at bad guys until a really large bad guys shows up and then shoot at him Do it again Eventually the game ends Ive done all of this many many times before in other games in the last several yearsFortunately the cutscenes in RE6 are not obnoxiously long or even painful to watch as in some other games but they still pop up during times when you just want to PLAY the game not watch it As in other modern games with cutscenes there are many stretches during which you will sit through a cutscene only to regain control of your character so that you can walk down a single hallway and into yet another cutscene Sometimes rinse and repeat once or twice more after that This has become somewhat of a staple of video games these days and is rapidly wearing out its welcome  Scripted action sequences and scenes are plentiful but sadly very routine and lacking creativity such as a helicopter suddenly showing up to blow up cars in front of you or a zombie magically appearing in an apartment window and blowing up something in front of you with a rocket launcherThe length of the experience is a notable plus There are four campaigns each made up of 5 chapters and a good number of them will take many hours to beat leading easily to a total playtime of 2030 hours If youre looking for a game that has a high timemoney ratio then this is a good pick  I dont like multiplayer addons and cannot comment on those aspects of this gameOverall to me the problem with this game is that is does nothing new and nothing memorable Ive played this game many times before under a variety of names and titles and God knows there are more to come I get why developers are morphing popular nonaction series into action series because they appeal to a broader audience and are more financially palatable to publishers and investors But I can still express my disappointment with this evolution in game design and I will still mourn the decline of memorable gameplay of many many years agoIn my opinion from a pure gaming point of view I wasnt miserable while playing RE6 but Im very proud that I only paid 20 for it A rental over an extended weekend would have probably worked even better Theres just no reason to pay more than that for an action shooter experience that you can experience any other day of the week,3.0,Havent I played this before,1369267200,"05 23, 2013",3

lot of important character traits while translating these to gameplay and the game works out wonderfully for itAs SpiderManPeter Parker youre dropped into a platforming action game where you have the ability to climb walls web swing across the city skyline and shoot SpiderMans trademark web shooters While the combat here certainly isnt as varied or deep as something like Maximum Carnage the level design here is wonderful and makes up a lot of what makes the game so great There are air vents to  crawl through walls to climb hidden powerups to collect Its a ton of fun just traversing these levelsWhat also helps is SpiderMans ability to take photos during these stages which Parker then sells to The Daily Bugle to support his superhero antics With the money he earns he spends it on the web fluid he needs as SpiderMan This is a great addition to the game as its done very well its a lot deeper than you initially imagine it being photos become an essential part of this game and its absolutely character appropriate On a regular basis youll earn 5 for taking photos of regular enemies and upwards of 250 for photos of super villains which appropriately make up the end bosses of these well designed varied stagesControl is pitch perfect Climbing walls web slinging around and generally being SpiderMan all feels natural to the Sega Genesis The game does a great job of making you feel like you can do whatever a spider can The web slinging web shooting and even the basic 3 attack combat controls are superior even to some of the more recent 16bit SpiderMan outings The web slinging feels extremely fluid especially when compared to the game based on the animated series or even the glorious Maximum CarnageGraphically the game fares OK This is an early GenesisMegadrive game after all Some things arent as detailed as I would have liked to see in a 16bit game of this type but for the time this released the visuals are definitely serviceable There are great static cutscene images that look as though they were ripped straight from the comics and all of the characters are immediately recognizableThe boss fights in this game require a fair bit of trial and error to complete While you may be able to get by with just beating down some of the bosses and hoping they die before you do for a lot of these encounters youll have to rely on a solid strategy Its about memorizing patterns and exploiting them Initially I hated some of these bosses Electro being the main offender However once I played the game more and figured out how to take these bosses out I could get past any of them with minimal troubleThese boss fights and the beating youll initially take from them lead me to the way health works in this game While there are health pickups found throughout some of the levels most arent nearly enough to fill your health bar all the way if youve taken a moderate amount of damage This is where Peter Parkers apartment comes into play The entire game is set on an ingame 24hour timer The timer moves quite slowly far from realtime though mind you but when you return to Parkers apartment it speeds up significantly This is because returning to the apartment is used as a means to regain lost health You take Spidey back there let him rest up for about an ingame hour about 1530 seconds in realtime then youre back at the beginning of the level you left off Much like the photography mechanic this health system is also quite deep and works well considering the timer here was made with great care Its lenient enough to give you more than a couple of hours to spare yet when you die and have to continue youll lose 2 hours on the clock Granted there are unlimited continues as long as you still have time to spare but its almost always better to heal up at your apartment than to flat out die The extra ingame hour you save is worth itThe audio here isnt spectacular A lot of the music fares well enough though its nowhere near Maximum Carnage Green Jelly quality The sound effects for punches kicks etc dont sound all too wonderful either From an audio standpoint this is a passable game Which is a shame as every other aspect is perfect IMO It makes me wish this exact same game were released later in the Genesis lifecycle with better sound and visuals However there is a great Sega CD version of this game that fixes a lot of the issues I have as well as adding new mechanics to the gameplayAll in all I would recommend either version The Amazing SpiderMan vs The Kingpin gets so many things right about SpiderMan its easy to overlook the flaws such as the poor implemented minibosses That being said I believe every boss fight is fun up to and including the Kingpin and theyre all intense in their own way This can be a really short game but its definitely not an easy one Its not the hardest game ever or anything like that but its definitely a challenging enough experienceThis is a truly great game and honestly one of the best SpiderMan games ever made It gets nearly everything down to a perfect character appropriate science and any Spidey fan would be doing themselves a disservice by passing this one up This isnt nostalgia talking either I didnt even get the chance to play this when I was a kid I genuinely love this game as an adult though and think it surpasses even later SpiderMan game entries Like I said the game is absolutely a great time Its a great way to spend an afternoon and I cant stress enough how fans of Spidey really should not pass this one up Its still worth a look to this day,5.0,One of the best SpiderMan games

AOGRIMH5H12J,B001QXNBJM,Animal,"[3, 7]",I finally finished the campaign and added it to the end of my original multiplayer review  I have a good amount of gaming time with both franchises  I was already a big fan of COD4 when I got BC1  I was not impressed with the lack of class customization and felt it did not have much of a reply value so I went back to COD4  MW2 is a great game but disappointed in several ways  The turned up damage made shootouts short and unsatisfying  No team coordination made playing without friends frustrating  Select class combos made combat cheesy Tac knife runner Duel shotgun runner Old javelin cheat  I found myself more frustrated than having fun and decided to stop playing MW2  My brother convinced me to try the BC2 demo and from that day I was hookedI wanted to point out a few highlights that separate this game from MW2 and BC1The speed of the game is up to you  Large maps and lots of cover will facilitate numerous playing styles  There are a lot of areas that are less traveled and allow for flanking maneuvers or sniper spots  You are able to wait in cover for extended periods of time allowing for more tactical movement or for the stealthy approach  Ive already been chastised for camping something severely looked down upon in MW  The rules are different in BC establishing a defense and eliminating a threat no matter what they are doing is the name of the game  Things like establishing a kill zone or stealing vehicles disturb the enemys operations tempo which is a viable tactic for victoryKits are now better balanced and allow some customization  Assault is the backbone for antiinfantry operations  Rifles are good balance of power accuracy and rate of fire ROF  They are able to carry a grenade smoke or darts shotgun launcher  They are the only source of ammo on the battlefield  Engineer can play several roles  They can repair vehicles as well as can carry rocketsmines to destroy them  Their primary weapon is a silenced SMG which is deadly for CQB and flanking maneuvers  The Medic is the only source of healing and can revive downed teammates  They carry a LMG and can be a very effective attacker or support gunner  The Sniper can be an effective means of disturbing the enemy at distant  They can specialize in a boltaction for longrange kills or a semiauto for more tactical ops  They can be demolition experts with C4 or the mortar strike  With the spotter scope they can provide quick recon data  Although customization is not even close to MW some options allow you to put different sights on your weapons decide if you want to carry more ammo have more accuracy or damage  They now also allow any class to carry a small selection of shotguns SMG and riflesVehicles can play a major part in your victory but are only as good as the support  A dedicated engineer with infantry support can ensure a tank can last the fight  On the other end a coordinated rocket attack or C4mine strike could halt a tanks advance  Depending on the map you can have a medium scale tanks battles andor chopper supportDestruction is what sets this game apart from every other FPS youve played  The battlefield is ever changing and you must adapt or die  The game allows you to destroy almost everything and you find that good cover is a temporary convenience  Destruction will continually present you opportunities or obstacles that will sway the outcome of battle  A house that made for a good observation point maybe completely gone next time you go to it or a simple hole in a wall may become a vital sniper positionSound quality is the finest of any other FPS Ive played  You will hear the echoing gunfire indoors and the explosions will rattle your eardrums  Crouching is an important tool when you moving in the snow to walking up the stairs as you sneak up on your enemy  Lastly you will hear the crackle of every sniper shot that flies pass your domeJRod thanks for the addition  The damage is another aspect that I think is done well in this game  With a good eye and a disciplined trigger finger you can drop enemies at range fairly easy with a nonscoped weapon  At the same time you can play the rush still take some good hits and continue to contribute to the attack  If youre one of those guys that complain that its taking too many bullets to kill then the game does offer Hardcore modeNeed to finish this with a few CONSCustomization has improved from the first game but still in the shadow of MW seriesSquads are limited to 4 people and may hamper large partiesServers problems can be frustrating it may take several minutes or you may need to wait a while before finally joining a match Hopefully this is fixed in the longrunTo add to the server problems I have kicked from the game and it has froze on me 34 timesThis is a longer review than I wanted but if I missed anything or need more data please add it in the comments  If youre new to MW2BC2 please read the indepth reviews of both games and ignore the 12 star spam  If you think you want an arena type shooter and want something fast paced and always in the thick of heavy gunfire MW2 way be your game  If you want something that rewards on cooperation as well as kills has vehicle combat and destructible environments look no furtherUpdate I finshed the campaign on normal and it was not very long 6 hours  It comprises of 13 levels which all were very entertaining  Although the backbone of the campaign comprised of close to medium range gunfights it ensured that levels did not get too repeditive  You get the whole battlefield experience from run  gun to tank battles  The game will allow you to be behind the steering wheel of several vehicles  The level design is fairly linear but overall combat reminded me a little of Fry Cry  In several parts you will be able to see your objective comprised of a compound or village  Although there is only one way to get to the objective you are free to flank and maneuver once in it  Even linear scenarios have houses and other cover that allow to get the advantage on the enemy  One thing I really liked is collectable weapons now serve a purpose  At checkpoints there are supply points that allow you to swap for any 2 two weapons that you have pickedup in the game  This allows you to adapt to the current scenario or to your specific playing style  It is important as you play that you check weapon caches and weapons that were carried by your enemy  Another sidequest are destroying MCOM stations  The game will tell you how many there are on a map but it is up to you to explore the level to find them all  Other than great combat Bad Company comes back with fresh and funny material  In this round it feels little more natural finding the right time to make you laugh instead of throwing you oneliners every other minute  The last thing I wanted to cover is difficultly and first play on normal was just about right  Even on normal it was not an easy walk and remaining out of cover for 23 seconds ended in a quick death  Enemy fire will cause you to take cover and shift your position as they advance and flank  Like multiplayer destruction will play a significant role on how you fight  Ive had my cover blown up several times and I even had a house collapse on me  Overall it was a great ride but a short one  For those who are looking for a single player only I would suggest something with a little more depth since you can beat this in a day,4.0,How modern warfare was meant to be played full review,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",3

A24O6U575872K1,B001SGZL2W,B Mills,"[11, 12]",I dont typically review anything which already has copious reviews but this game is so unique and I am bored at work that I felt the need to review RRDThis game has a nice little introscene which reveals the setting 1911  how cool and sets the tone nicely for a game which feels like a classic western movie starring Clint EastwoodIn terms of game play the two games I was immediately reminded of were Oblivion and GTA  But let me make this clear right now this is NOT those two games its a really unique experienceI never played Red Dead Revolver but I played GUN for the ps2 and this game is kind of like that but a million times betterIts like GTA in ways some more overt then others like the wanted level thing but its not really a sandbox game at all  Its an open world I suppose in that theres a big map and you can ride around on your horse but after a few missions many of which streamlessly lead into each other you realize this is just a great single player story that has been arranged so that you have a little bit of choice between which and when you do the missions or deal with something more pertinent like shooting a cougar in the face on your way to townI know that GTA is similar to what I described but thats because its hard to quantify the experience in RDR but suffice it to say where in GTA you can get completely distracted with hey whats that thing or I want that car  or doing countless racing challenges or play cop after stealing a cop car and as a result neglect the main story which feels somewhat disjointed as you haphazardly beat one mission or another well RDR is not like thatYeah you can steal horses if you want to and you can play bounty hunter and there are side missions but overall it feels like its part of the narrative not a distraction and the main missions play together really well and actually succeed in feeling like the events in the order for which you choose to play them could work as the exact plot to a classic but really long cowboy movie like they used to make none of this Jonah Hex crap wait two weeks to know what I am talking aboutIn terms of the Oblivion likeness maybe its the horse which you can ride through the country side looking for happenings or maybe its the whole man on a missionbut do this thing for me first and maybe I will help you  but I just got the vibe2 hours in and I had forgotten all about Oblivion  First and this might be obvious this is a not an RPG well maybe by JRPG standards har har har but seriously no dialogue options talking to strangers consists of tipping your hat and making some generic greeting but thats because this game has a story and the main character has an actual identity and its a pleasure to watch it unfoldAs I mentioned in the GTAcomparison section the story flows really well and keeps you hooked however the result of this is unlike games like Oblivion or more obviously the wonderful InFamous where your every actions seems to change the world around you not the case in RDRThe ability to choose your mission selection means that you might be at a ranch where everyone was slaughtered and then an hour later youll be at the same ranch everyone is alive and well  Theres not a whole lot of permanence in your actions other then the storys narrative being advancedIn short the setting is not a fluid organic thing similar to most other games which are driven by a tight story from beginning cinematic to end cinematic the difference is that this game creates an illusion of openness and the illusion is great the ability to ride your horse anywhere you want when you want to makes you feel like you own this character even though he has been 100 created for you by Rockstar it helps that his and everyone else character is fantasticNone of this is a criticism not exactly anyway well get to that either I have enjoyed GTAs but never finished one Im the poster child for ADD and its just too much work for me to get through the whole thing I do side stuff until I forget what the hell is even going on in the story then I play a new game Ill end up getting plenty of hours out of it but never finishOblivion never finished I got too obsessed with trying to play a perfect game join every group do every quest  Once again lots of hours 149 to be exact but still not finishedI will finish RDR and keep playing for those that say its short compared to GTA well its long compared to GOW3 and no one complained there because it was a great experience same thing here I am really excited to beat this game because the story is so good where the story in most GTA games is moderately amusing as a satire but gets oldHowever its a 44 review 4 fun 4 overall  Why  Well the gameplay is defiantly fun but there are some missed opportunities the Wanted system works but it could have been so much better  Its very similar to GTA but where as in GTA wanted level equated to highspeed chases racing your stolen car through oncoming traffic narrowly avoid car wrecks or not and having a fantastic explosion in RDR its just riding your horse through the desert makes sense but not excitingThen you have a bounty which you precede to pay off  No biggie  Its a barebones game mechanic that gets the job done but something a little more complex where pictures of you went up around town and if they didnt catch you they couldnt confirm it was you but some guy that looks like you and the sheriffs try harder to catch you red handed etc  But alas not the case  Overall this system makes an otherwise more realistic game have a bit of an arcade feel at timesThis complaint well call it that for lack of a better word is indicative over the one thing plaguing the singleplayer that opportunities for actions to really effect anything other than your fame or honor bars maybe if when you saved a guys life that guy had a name etc and he would buy you a drink every time you went to the saloon and he was there just a thought But instead everyone who is not a main character is pretty facelessThe multiplayer is pretty weak  I have a hard time penalizing games because of a subpar multiplayer when the singleplayer is spot on but in this case it really feels like a shame  A less ambitious multiplayer maybe a smaller world that kept the players closer together with more to do then shoot each other or hordes of random Mexicans would have been really cool  Its a lark for a bit you start with a Mule and look like a homeless person and level up but theres not much to it and it gets boring fastSo overall 4 out of 5 on fun lots and lots of fun to play I dont want to put it down but its not a perfect experienceNow where I traditionally bump up the overall to a 5 is when the polish really wows alas this game can be glitchy  It hasnt gone to the point of cumbersome for me yet but if they didnt have checkpoints in the middle of missions I would have lost it by now I can NOT tell you how often I fail a mission due to glitch  Everything will go fine and WHAM FAILED you abandoned soandso  when I was right next to him or you fail because you didnt do something right I can get more specific because I dont want to spoil anything but then do it the exact same way and it goes off without a hitchThen the game gets hungup sometimes thank God for autosave or this game might be unplayable due to glitches  Overall thanks to the aforementioned safety nets it doesnt amount to more than a minor annoyance but it is frustrating when you stats arent accurate due to it and it can interrupt the overall experienceAlso riding horses is tough at first do yourself a favor open up the options and change horse controls from relative to horse to relative to camera what were they thinking with that one  Also they dont do a great job explaining the whole horses stamina thing or Dead Eye and how it works  the manual is almost worthless it looks nice but its 5 pages long and not that full of info but high its full color rightHeres a couple quick tips the blue bar in the left is your horse stamina yeah watch that  much easier now huh  Oh that read bar thats your DeadEye meter not repeat NOT your life got it  To activate DeadEye aim then click R3 this is essentialOn this topic some of the controls can be cumbersome it seems to hard to me to switch weapons which includes your lasso and ride a horse AND keep on target how many fingers do they think I have  But I couldnt really tell you how to make it better theres a lot of stuff to do sometimes  But little things would be nice like a map button so I didnt have to go thought the menu and some people dont like being forced to use L2 and R2 to fire I like it but thats personal I can see the irritation of no customizationI mean in reality it would be pretty hard to switch guns and ride a horse while chasing someone and I have always been an advocate if the task is hard dont fault the game for making it feel hardAnd this game is not easy I often found the missions in GTA to be boring unless they involved a car in some fashion  The shooting mechanics have always been weak GTA3 lockon target and just shoot the guy a bunch of times GTA4 had some rudimentary coversystem but the whole thing was pretty awfulRDR is fun and hard  The single player isnt terribly difficult to get through but it remains challenging enough to be enjoyable all the way through but a lot of the random side stuff is actually hard youll kill the bad guy in the end but were you fast enough to save the person  Most of the time not  Dont worry youll get like a 1000 more chances to do better and it will be fun each and every time BECASUE its hard otherwise it would be like Assassins Creed really this againAnd where the cars in GTA4 drove like dump trucks on a hockey rink the horses ride beautifully in this game just watch HOW they run for one thing and youll be amazed they get snagged on things sometimes and they INSIST on jumping over anything if your moving AT ALL even if your just trying to slow them down and get off but after a bit youll get the hang of itSo this Review turned out to be a lot longer than anticipated but I had a lot of fun writing it and I wanted to share these thoughts with people who were like me asking themselves everyone likes this game some nutcases hate it but will I get hooked or will I get bored and lose interestI got hooked and hopefully if youre on the fence my review helped if just a bit,4.0,Feels like a classic western movie plays like a game  Win,1275523200,"06 3, 2010",3

A1CLUR3JCYO0TQ,B002I0JAVK,stevie,"[0, 1]",After playing this I regret I never got the chance to play the first one Well it has been fun so far but it is not the gem that all the review sites have said it is Its technically an open world game You are confined within the boundaries of arkham city This works well for the story because it allows the developers extended liberties with the villains as they are all working with and against each other inside the city And they are all worked in fairly well despite the focus being primarily on the Joker The story itself isnt really that hard to follow but I found myself losing interest sometimes because of all the different characters there are Its also one of those games where you take two steps back and one step forward at every plot point A task to go find freeze turns into first running into the penguin who has actually captured freeze fighting all the penguin bad guys and then finding freeze But then Freeze cant help you until you do Freeze a favor After you help Freeze who helps you then tries to kill you another villain pops up and you have to go chase them Batman also appears nonchalant when running into these various enemies However this does keep things fresh despite their disjointed feel You run into Robin Killer Croc and rescue vicki vale from a helicopter crash Sometimes I wish there was more dynamics in these interactions Robin is there almost as lip service to the character If you have the dlc you can play as him but he is not a big part of the storyThe game also suffers sometimes from what i like to call random good guy appearance to save the situation mode You know where you are in trouble and then someone just shows up off screen to save you I see it as a failure to take a risk with the characters And its something we have all seen way too many times However the game will have different endings based on a choice you can make as catwoman to either save batman or not save batman Its kind of interesting and a nice change of pace to give the player the option to choose a plot pointEverything about the game you heard was great is in factgreat So I wont spend too much time on them The gameplay is solid Fighting mechanics are fun Grappling and gliding around is fluid and looks cool The gadgets are cool as well as actually serving a purpose in the game you really feel like batman The game will often just leave you alone with no idea of really where to go next Thinking like batman will often get you of the situationThere are two things I didnt like1 The environment is too dreary Its not fun to explore like in other open world games You do a lot of backtracking but its difficult to recognize places The color palette is all greys blacks and dirty browns Everything is crusted over I think they went a little too far with the destruction of arkham I know it should be like that because of what is going on but I would prefer sacrificing some of that for some color This also makes the game graphically difficult to judge I dont think its graphically as good as red dead redemptions environments or character models But its hard to judge the environment because everything is so downtrodden and the broken buildings start to look the same inside and out2 There is a certain part of the fighting system I dont like You have to beat up an enemy severely until you knock them out because batman dosnt kill people however he has no problem breaking limbs and landing punches that would probably cause brain damage anyway Often they will lie on the ground unconscious but still able to get up You have to do a ground slam to finish them off Imagine playing uncharted but then the guys you punch just lay there for awhile and then get back up The game compensates by eventually letting you level up to perform critical strikes Critical strikes are basically finishing moves so you can string together as many as possible landing knock out blows However you can only do this after a 5 times combo where you then have to press X immediately after you finish one move and before the next one This is actually more difficult than it sounds At later points in the game you will be surrounded by 20 more bad guys If you button mash which you almost do anyway because there are so many you will miss the critical strike Thus you will be knocking guys out but they will get up and keep fighting you In the meantime you are being attacked by 20 other guys The guy you just knocked out then comes to fight you again and you have to keep punching him some more until hes finished I wish they would have just let you knock guys out after the first series of punchesBut if these issues do not bother you then the game is basically a ten as far as tens go,4.0,Really fun but not as perfect as they say,1331424000,"03 11, 2012",3
A14A2UV4I4VJ76,B007VFHGZ4,Kevin L Williams K Skate,"[5, 7]",I can remember back when I was in High School and I played the original Tomb Raider on the PC  I can remember how it made me feel like what I was playing at the time was a game that many many games of the future would try to imitate and improve  I remember how I felt the first time I played Mario 64 and the WOW factor it gave me to see what was once 2D now being presented in 3D  During the introduction level where you take control of the new Lara Croft for the first time I imediately knew that this experience would be added to the list of what I mentioned earlier  The presentation itself is in a league of its own and has the controls to actually back it up  I personally prefer to play the game with the 360 control pad but the mousekeyboard setup isnt that bad either  When a game has a good presentation I like to compare it to SKATE  I know 2 COMPLETELY different types of games but what TOMB RAIDER and SKATE both have in common is that the game makes you want to make it look good  The sound is awesome everything from ambiance music voice acting and especially the emotional reactions from Lara herself are all done very very well  According to other people who play the game on PC I noticed with TressFX enabled I would get a constant 30 FPS that would sometimes drop to about 2427  With the feature turned off I maintain 60 FPS  I am unsure if there will be a fix but I also noticed that my game would crash at times with the feature turned on as well  I am using the GTX 680 to run this game but have also read that other users of the  600 series cards are experiening the same issues  While this feature does make Laras hair look great and add to the beauty of the game you really cant tell the visual loss with it turned off unless you are standing against a wall and you pan the camera around to focus on her hair  So with that being said I prefer the FPS gain over the visuals of her hairIf you are a fan of the Uncharted series or the platforming adventure type games this is a must own game for you  Due to the fact that this game has hit the shelf long before the next inevitable Uncharted release on the PS4 expect to see many other games in this genre take elements and ideas from this game like they did with the original  This game is a very good indication and does a very good job of letting us gamers see what singleplayer focused games are going to be like in the near future  I am very excitedEDITI forgot to mention one thing I dont care too much for in the gameThe QTEs Quick Time Events At times they are required a little too frequently and if you mess it up you will die  Unfortunatly sometimes they are too easy to fail but I found that if you just keep hitting the required button within the circle you will make it through  On the good side though the QTEs are very well placed  What would clearly otherwise be a cutscene they did a good to find a way to keep you engaged in the game,5.0,Shes baaaaack,1362528000,"03 6, 2013",3

extras to it and called it part 3if you think mw2 was perfect than this game will seem perfect to you too so in that casebuy itotherwiseif you didnt think it was perfect then read onthis review is for multiplayer and survival mode on ps3 not the campaign mode which i never playthings they didnt fix and may never fix and dont care about fixing obviouslySPAWN CAMPING is still as possible and easy as evernothing like dying within 3 seconds becausepeople know where you will spawn they obviously dont care or cant change how spawning worksit may be a bug but sometimes people will spawn right beside you or behind at the spawn point right after you spawnand kill you from behind when you were already in a corneryou will often be spawned into gunfire and explosions too and be killed instantly after spawningwhat they NEEDED to do was get rid of spawn POINTS and have no set spawn POINTS where you can spawn but rather make the spawnoccur in ANY random area that is clear of enermiesthe place you spawn SHOULD never repeat but it sure does but they dont care about that but thats a huge issueHolding down the square button STILL does almost everything other than shoot same old problem nothing new here except now you have even MORE stuff topick up and move around use the square button to do just about everythingso if you are next to alot of your equipment or crates or whatever you will have no way to distinguish between this or that and probablyreload when you dont want to and get killed if you want to move something when you have two things nearby like a crate youwill not be able toby the time somebody comes along and kills youapparantly they dont know the ps3 has lots of other buttons they could usebesides holding down the square buttonStill no way to customize your own buttons eitherkillstreaks dont stack up for example if you get a care package and die then spawn and earn another care packageBEFORE you use the first one you WONT have 2 carepackages now you will still only have ONEif you earn two stealth bombers without using one you still only have onevery dum could be a bug but a doubt itI thinkits intentional that wayMAPS theres not nearly enough maps you end up playing the same maps over and over til you want to scream all the maps seemthe same except for one or two all are just boring city blocks IMHO I played the game for two days and im already sick of the mapsnone of the maps really have any kind of a THEME like black ops does like black ops has a golf course or missle launch site etcintermissions same as before the game still always makes you wait a full long 60 seconds in between games even when everyone is ready to playits so dumb because if you need an intermission YOU CAN JUST LEAVE THE LOBBY and give one to yourself why they dont realize how dumb theirintermission system is i dont know so usually if you dont want to wait you end up quiting during intermission to find another game ready to goand end up joining the game right as its about to END so you just cant winserver issues and lagwhich brings me to other issues the game will try to put you in a game in progress often times and load it up for like I dunno FOREVER and thencome back and say lost connection to host THERE IS NEVER A WAY TO ABORT JOINING A GAME There is no manual overrideSo if its taking FOREVER and you know its going to error outsome server error you still cant do ANYTHING about it except wait which is really dumbMy nat is moderate or open on every other fps i own including black ops but on this game the nat type is always strictit tells you to go to  for help all that does it give you a link to router companies websitesit doesnt ever tell you anything about opening certain ports on your router you have to bypass your router to get anopen nat and even then there is still lag lag ruins this kind of gamewhen you play you often get a lot of lag and the game is often so dumb it often WONT EVEN TRY to migrate the hostwhen it obviously needs too since you have obvious lag other timesit keeps migrating the host like constantly maybe 3 or 4 times until it finally gets it right other times the game will be over but before you can get the score to displayit stops and says MIGRATING host and makes you wait just to be free to quit and find another lobby to joinit doesnt seem to matter about your connection either because i bypassed my router to get an open nat and i STILL had lagits something else probably has alot to do with who is actually hosting the game 99 of the time i had some type of lagThis bug existed before in mw2 too its like using the same exact engine as mw2 the bug is alot of times but notconsistantly just alot of times you will be low on ammo go to reload and it will show your dude reloading andwhen he is done you still have NOT reloadedand you need to reload yet AGAIN in order to actually reloadprosthey added alot of killstreak awards though only a few are coolthey let you change killstreaks per each loadoutthey let you choose when to use which killstreak award it doesnt have to be use last oneacheived first anymoreit depends on which killstreak it is some do require you to use it last one firstsurvival modeaside from it being 2 player max which is pretty lameit takes a long time to find a player to play withcuz many will just quit then theres a stupid built in 30 second intermission when you do as if itdidnt take long enough to find a player now it forces you to wait longer how dumb is thatall the enemies show up on the minimap which also makes it too easy sometimesit lets you call in an AI squad to help you fight the AI which is dumbbecause why would you want AI allies to help you killother AI enemies and if your teammate calls them in you cant prevent it Its like letting the computer play against itself If you are playingits because you want to shoot at things not watch the AI troops shoot other AI troops wowif theres any lag for 3 seconds it will stop the game and wont let you continue on solo eitherif your teammate sucks and keeps dying you must keep reviving him or else you LOSE you cant just finish the roundby yourself like you can in black ops zombiesback to multiplayerdoesnt stop to balance teams on team matches like when its 6 people vs 2 people for instance it just keeps going like thatlamestill bs miracle kills from them while you shoot them plus claymore them and they survive and run away or shoot you twice and kill you insteadstill appears to be a miss but counts it as a hit especilly with snipersflashbangs still burn your eyes out instead of just turning screen black or something trying to be too realistic in annoying waysstill wont just let you spectate without kicking you outchanged from 2 claymores at one time to only one like blak ops whyall knife weapons still too strongonly one setting for sound instead of different types of sound like black ops hasadditional issuescan see thru walls sometimes glitchysome cover provides no protection at all some weak cover like glass that never breaksprovides way too much protectionthey kill with one or two shots after taking huge damage and no shields could possibly be obtained yetwhen it recovers from host mirgration you can lose effects and messes up gamedoesnt count kills toward streak sometimes especially if it happens rite before you dieprone still can get stuk way too easily and you cant turn as if your virtual body has no JOINTS in itsometimes you get completely stuck on pixels of things like cranes forklifts random obstacles etccant jump on top of almost anything depsite it being lowgun still auto changes when it gets empty so if you try to change guns manually you end up with the same empty gun againjavelin appears huger than a man on screenblocks view etcjavelin only weapon that doesnt change to full gun when empty sometimes wowjavelin will often hit the ceiling and kill u but not themno MUTE all STILL so if you want to mute people you have to do it one at a time constantlythe speaker icon when people yap is in bad place its annnoying seeing speaker icon come up on your screenwhen you try to mute people it unmutes other people at the same time must be a glitchbugONE OF THE DUMBEST things in the game you can lay down and walk into firewow does that fact alone just sum up how lame this game isyou can crawl thru dead bodies and you have to because they dont disapear fast enoughno access to all maps unless you play team games really dumb ideathe maps are all boring and lack any themes most have few rooms to even to go intooverall black ops is a much better game and zombies is way better than survival mode the best thing about survival mode is you can get sentry gunsi wish zombies had sentry guns in it hahai hope you appreciate the

A3Q5QOWMVPTAN2,B000GPXS94,James Chapman WarriorForge,"[102, 104]",After some disappointing Fun packs the Sims 2 lineup finally has an addition thats worth it  As the name implies this expansion is all about Pets  Your sims can have dogs small or large cats birds and womrats basically a guinea pig  There are a lot of fun interactions to run the sims through with their pets  Now for the detailsPROS Pets  Just about enough said there As with the people sims pet sims are very well portrayed  The movements and behaviors are very realistic  Just have a people sim play with a cat with a teaser toy and youll see what I mean Creating a Pet is as easy as creating a people sim  You can modify their features give them various colored collers etc  With little effort I was able to create a cat that looks and behaves very much like our real life cat Createapet also has ability to create a breed  Dont find the breed you want  Make one  There is one exception noted in the CONS section below though Werewolves  Dont get too friendly with that wolf that visits your lotunless your people Sim is a Knowledge Sim  They all seem to WANT to become a werewolf for some reason  The matchmaker from Nightlife sells cures for lycanthropy if youre unfortunate though  HmmSims 2 had Aliens University added Zombies Nightlife added Vampires Open for business added robots and now we have werewolves  Makes me wonder what the upcoming Season expansion will add Pets can have jobs that add a little income to the family as well  Service Pets Security Pets and Show Pets are in high demand  Just be ready to teach them tricks so that they can get those promotions Some nice new objects floor tiles and wallpapers  Most of it is Pet themed as should be expected but these are actually more useful than much of what is in the Fun packs New Tools  The Hammer tool makes remodeling so much nicer  If you want to make a room bigger add some new walls outside of a current room then use the Hammer tool to get rid of the one wall thats blocking the new addition from the old  Much nicer than having to live with all of the previous walls  Also the walls you remove are assigned a value and then that much is added back to your funds much like selling old objects to replace with new  Remodeling isnt near as expensive as it used to be either Leveling Tool  Another new tool allows you with one click to level an entire lot to the level of the sidewalk  You used to have to drag the cursor over the whole lot and you had to exclude the boundary squares to level it and even then there was no guarantee that it would be even with the sidewalk  This new tool makes it much more simple and quick  You can still use the old leveling tools if you want variable terrain though Unlockable Goodies  I can understand someone wanting everything available at the beginning but unlockable content adds a little reward for accomplishing certain milestones  This encourages more play like we really need more incentive to play this game Skunk Some might consider this a con  Watch out for Stinky Skunk  He she will visit your lot sooner or later  What happens if Stinky Skunk doesnt like your pet  Welllets just say youd better have a people sim prepared to give your pet a bath and fastCONS The Create a PetBreed utility though great for some reason doesnt allow you to modify a dogs leg length  Because of this creating a believable Dachshund wiener dog or Corgi is as yet impossible Im not a huge Dachshund fan dont dislike them either but I do like Corgis so that was disappointing Bugs  For some reason some people sims have their wants disappear  Having another controllable sim ask them what they want is one way around this but its a pain when you just need one more want satisfied to put the sim in gold status but you dont know what they want  Thats a new bug that Ive noticed with Sims 2 Pets  Many of the bugs from previous Sims 2 expansions are still there as well  Does EA know what a patch is Would have liked to have seen a new Pet Lover Aspiration in addition to the ones we already have  There is one Lifetime Aspiration one that creates permanent Platinum Status for having 6 pets reach the top of their career chains I believe this one is a potential life time aspiration for Fortune Sims so the prospect wasnt completely ignored Taking care of and training Pets can be work  If youre a glutton for punishment get a sim couple who are still early in their careers with a toddler to take care of then give them a male and female dog have the dogs spawn puppies and then start a home business assuming you have Open for Business expansion  If you accomplish this and keep everyone happy my hat is off to you   Birds and Womrats work similar to the Aquarium that already existed in the game though you can interact with them unlike the fish  If you get busy with other things theyre easy to forget and they die even if you keep the food dish full  Birds can be taught to talk and they will fly around if you let them out of their cage not sure why I put this paragraph in the CONS section  I dont find the Saltwater aquarium any more exciting than the original oneIn summary this is indeed the best Expansion Pack yet for Sims 2  On a scale of 1 to 5 I would give this a 7 for fun alone  The bugs though not show stoppers still led me to give it an overall score of 4 stars  I still strongly recommend the game though  The fun does overcome the occasional frustration of the bugs  This one will easily keep me occupied until the upcoming SeasonalWeather Expansion Im assuming every house will need a roof for more than cosmetic reasons when that one comes out,4.0,The Best Expansion Yet,1163462400,"11 14, 2006",3

A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ,B002I0H27E,NutwiisystemCom,"[406, 418]",I tend to divide fitness video games into two categories fun motion games like Kinect Star Wars and Kung Fu Live where you get a workout just in the course of playing a game and pure exercise games that are designed from the groundup to be workout games In the world of pure fitness games so far there have been two contenders for being the best on the Kinect Your Shape Fitness Evolved and Adidas MiCoachIm happy to say that from what Ive seen do far Nike Kinect Training powers its way to the top of the list It has the most accurate motion detection and interface of all the workout games Ive seen to date has a truly innovative fitness test and puts together workout routines that really feel personalized for youWhile the Adidas game had appearances by animated versions of very recognizable athletes such as Dwight Howard and Eric Berry with Nike you have animated versions of Alex Molden or Marie Pervis both best known as Nike certified trainers although Molden did spend 9 years in the NFL I found that fact that these are actual trainers lends a bit more credibility to the training as opposed to other games which hire big name athletes or pop stars to drive salesThe concept of the game is quite simple You start out by selecting your goal such as Get Strong to increase your power and build explosiveness Get Toned to develop lean muscle and muscle definition or Get Lean to maximize calorie and fat burn Then you go through a fitness assessment after which youll get a customized circuit training routine to do over the next four weeks In other video games I tried the assessment is really just smoke and mirrorshowever you do on your fitness test those games will give you the exact same workout routine and call it a personalized one With Nike Kinect the workouts I was given really feel customized to my exact goalsThe Fitness Challenge basically runs you through a series of exercises using the Kinect to measure both how well your form is and how many reps of each exercise youre doing Youll see a video image of your animated trainer and a silhouette of yourself next to him or her One thing to keep in mind is that you need a minimum of 8 feet in front of your Kinect sensor with a clear view of the floor and youll also need a good 810 feet from left to right for certain exercises where youll be jumping from side to side EDIT some have reported that 8 feet is not even enough for certain exercises in any case if you get stuck with the system unable to track you just use voice command XBOX  TRACKING OFF to proceed with the exercises Thanks to Hans for the tipEach exercise is similar in that youll see your trainer to the left of the screen and youll see a silhouette of your body to the right Your silhouette will be orange at first but will glow blue when youre using the correct form The Kinect is extremely precise and did a great job of gauging whether I was doing the exercises right each timeThe first part of the assessment tests your lower body and upper body mobility by having you strike a few poses first lying down and raising each leg and then standing up and stretching with your arms behind your backThe next part of the assessment has you doing a variety of exercises from a hop and stick this is the one that requires a ton of space from left to right a squat jump Whats really cool about this is that not only does the system judge your performance itll also give you detailed data that you can try to beat each time you do the exercise for example the squat jump will tell you your vertical leap in inchesTheres a cool exercise that tests your speed reaction and agility where you have to hop and jump to various targets on the ground Youre also tested on squats pushups and high knee sprints Again I loved how you could set a benchmark and then try to beat it with each rep you do A bar on the bottom of the screen will show you how good your form is the more it fills up the better youre doing I also loved how the system displayed things like time and reps its stylistically integrated into the background of the scenery in a way thats easy to read and has a certain coolness factorMotion sensing was excellent something I always try to test with these kinds of games I tried to throw it off several times but it seemed to do a great job of keeping up with meAfter your evaluation youre given something called a unique fuel print an interesting metric that tracks your Fitness Score on one side and your Athleticism on the other side During the test you basically establish a benchmark and then every four week youre given the same test to see how much youve improved I started with both numbers in the 30s which I knew meant I had a LOT of room for improvementYoure also set up with a custom 4week workout that focuses on your goals as well as things from your fitness evaluation that need improvement Theres a cool visual representation that shows the system picking the right exercises for you The exercises in the workout routine are along the line of what I described above doing various exercises where youre evaluated on how well your form and your execution are The virtual trainer does give excellent feedback of your performanceAt first I was excited because all the marketing material pointed to this game being tightly integrated into the whole Nike system It turns out the integration is not very deep at all If you have a Nike Fuelband youll earn NikeFuel playing this game just like you would doing any other exercise but other than that theres not direct connection nor interaction between the FuelBand and Kinect Training Kinect Training will sync in summary form to your NikePluscom profile so you can view your overall Kinect Training statistics on the site next to your FuelBand statistics but thats itOne thing I also love about the game is that its supported by Kinect PlayFit so calories burned will be counted along with all your other PlayFitcompatible gamesThe one thing I wish this title had was more fun activities where you could get exercise by simulating real sports or activities This is something that other titles such as Your Shape Fitness Evolved and EA Sports Active 2 both have that provide some nice variety and diversion to keep the workouts from getting too monotonous While Nike Training has some of that theres an interesting game where you need to move your body to avoid shattering a pane of glass thats coming toward you for the most part its still mostly like a virtual experience at a gym so if you have a tough time getting motivated to go to the gym every day chances are you might have a tough time keeping up with regular workouts with this game That said the game does  basic training and

A2FUQ7N2L11PWP,B0050SXLQC,Richard P Montgomery,"[27, 34]",Firstly i would like to say that i almost ended up not buying the game because of numerous negative reviews that slammed the game this is not a bad game by any means nor is it a perfect game the game spans over 4 separate campaigns that run parallel and at times intersect each campaign shows a different vantage point of the same main plot being a global bioterrorist attack the gameplay is a third person action shooter with horror elements the controls are a great improvement on the fifth installment in my opinion in RE5 it was an action game with controls that were too slow for the gamplay but this time around the controls are much more intuitive you can move while shooting and reloading as well as melee an enemy at any time the story is good and each campaign reveals a bit more about the terror attacks who caused them and why there are things that are not so good the camera can sometimes be a bit uncooperative and actually get too close to the character where you cant see the enemy your aiming at and since campaigns overlap there are a few sections that you will have to play more then once with a different character To close RE6 is a great game that i am glad i didnt pass up and even though it may never live up to our nostalgia of the first resident evil games and because the games are no longer survival horror that is no reason to slam the game the way many reviewers have My advice is to give the game a chance rent it or download the demo first if you are really skeptical about it but defiantly give it a look and dont snuff if off because of the negative reviews,5.0,Resident Evil 6 review,1349913600,"10 11, 2012",3

A3DZFEICHK5LF2,B009AGXH64,Just Trying to Help,"[889, 994]",Great News  Today 4302013 Nintendo released an update that resolved a lot of the problems that the Wii U had  My personal favorite is that you can now download and install games in the background and fully automatically  Yes it should have been like that since the beginning  Three cheers Ive updated my review to reflect this new informationOriginal review edited due to improvements by NintendoI remember that Nintendo came under a lot of criticism for not having an HD version of the Wii  HD was around when the first Wii came out and a lot of people were a bit skeptical that they stuck to the lower resolution  As HD became common Nintendo told fans that they had to do something more than just come out with an HD version of the WiiWell thats just what Nintendo did  The Wii U is more than just Wii HD  But Nintendo hasnt changed the Wii experience very much  You still use Wii remotes every time you play  The Wii U is not completely different like the Wii was when it came out  The Wii U is the Wiis younger smarter brother  And if you liked the Wii youll like the Wii UThe 3 main features of the Wii U are1 Its HD which brings it finally up to speed with the Xbox and Playstation  and everything else out there2 The Wii U has a single video controller  The video controller opens up new game experiences  Whoever is playing on the video controller sees something different than the other players  For generations people have wanted multiplayer games that didnt use a split TV screen and the Wii U gives you that in one console  This is a really big deal  The video controller is also a touchscreen which you use to flick something at the screen or move things on screen  The new video controller allows for new control options  just like the Wii balance board allowed Nintendo to sell yoga and ski games3 Videos videos videos  Netflix youtube TiVo amazon instant video  It will keep track of the TV shows you want to watch and when they will be on  Youll also be able to use the Wii U as a social outlet to chat about TV shows and movies  Nintendo calls this Wii TVii and it would be a revolution in TV watching if only all the features were available now  So you can use the Wii U as a control for all your Video experiences with your TV  The video controller will act like PIP Picture in Picture in the palm of your hand  I use the Wii U with Amazon Video to watch movies for free and the Wii remote lets me see information about the movie on IMDB WHILE the movie is playing  For sports youll be able to watch instant replays on the small screen while the rest of your buddies continue to watch the big game on the main screen  So its going to be a remote controller on steroids  To be honest this is going to be a really big big deal but since not all the features roll until later I cant give the WIi U a star for it yet  Maybe it will change your life maybe not  Time will tellAnd that concludes the main appeal of the Wii U  We finally get HD the video controller adds a new dimension to the usual Wii gaming and it also serves as a TV command centerFAQSome people have asked me about the Wii U and the short answers are1 No you dont have to own a Wii to have a Wii U2 You can only use ONE video controller with your Wii U  All other players use the old Wii remote3 5 people can play at once making it even more of a game party console than before4 You cant play DVDs or Blu Ray discs  Blue Ray is Sony Playstation territory as you probably know5 You can surf the internet on it why would you want to  I dont know6 Should I get the deluxe  Probably  You get 32gb of memory which will become more important the longer you have the console and the more you do with it  You get the Nintendo Land game  You get the cradle for charging the video gamepad  And until 2014 they will give you a store credit of 10 every time you make a purchase of digital content games  If you buy digital content regularly you might earn back the extra 50 you pay for the deluxe Wii U  I tried this yesterday read below for more info on the creditNintendoLANDNintendo Land has a nice set of games that introduce you to life with the video controller1 Some of the games are a lot of fun  The most popular minigames in our house are the game where one player pretends to be a ghost and scares other players  This is accomplished by having two screens the ghost can see everyone but nobody else knows where the ghost is  This is always a howling good time at our house  The Mario hide and seek works the same way and is also popular with us update after a month of play the Kids now play Zelda and Metroid the most2 Some of the games would be worth about 1 in an app store race game balloon game and yoshi game Im talking to you3 Some games have more than one control scheme  The Pikmin game is enjoyed by my 4 year old because he can use a stylus to direct Captain Olimar instead of the joysticksdpads  He just points at what he wants to do  So for the first time even my youngest can join in on at least some of the action4 Metroid and Zelda show off what the Wii U can do for multiplayer combatFPS In Metroid the player with the video controller operates a helicopter while everyone else are ground troops  The two screens allow for different perspectives in battleNintendoLand has satisfied my kids for a whole month but its really starting to wear off now  NintendoLand is particularly good if you have a lot of friends come over to your house  But its just a variety game and not very deep  Youll probably want to buy another game shortly after buying the Wii U  PS I bought Trine2 from the Nintendo eShop for 20 but I think it was worth about 10Other games since I wrote my original review I have bought a lot of other wii U games  However Im generally disappointed in the use of the video controller  In many games the video controller either shows you a map of the area or shows a version of whats on the big TV screen  Party games like the Rabbids game and Nintendo Land make the best use of the video controller  Single player games tend to make the worst use of it  I dont have all the games for the Wii U but thats been my general experienceThe Wii U has a host of lesser features1 A person can play the Wii U without having the TV on  Expect a smack on your head if you want to play ZombiU while your wife watches a movie2 Its backwards compatible with all older Wii games but maybe not dance pads which is nice if you bought Zelda Skyward Sword this summer3 Just as with the old Wii you can download games from the Nintendo store  If you buy online content for your iPhone Xbox or PS3 you know that this is a big deal  I used to buy songs for guitar hero to add to the songs that came in the box  If you buy this DELUXE version you get a 10 credit back for all online purchases see more about this credit in The Bad below4 The Wii U video controller is like a universal remote  You can turn on your TV and change the volume from the gamepad which is a convenience5 Most of the old Wii hardware is compatible too which is nice EXCEPT that round gamecube style connector is not present on the Wii U  Games that use a mat like outdoor challenge and Dance Dance Revolution become history in your house6 There is a big easy to find download again button for all digital content so if your Wii U got fried by a power surge you wouldnt lose your purchases  Thats always niceThe bad1 The menus arent intuitive  There are two menus the Wii U menu and the Home menu  The Home menu is found by pressing the Home button  Note that now that downloads are automatic the unintuitive menus arent so bad  But they still seem redundant2 Transferring data from the Wii to the Wii U should be easier  In particular I didnt like that when I imported my Miis I had to do a separate step on the Wii U before I could actually use them in the games  The day I got it the patch took way too long to download and install and after I transferred my data from my Wii I felt like I had spent 2 hours on the whole thing  But since then there has been no problem3 Freezing  I did have a problem with NintendoLand locking up but that went away after one day  This will be something they fix and becomes a thing of the past  I wouldnt sweat it4 Long updates  I feel that the time that it takes to download stuff and install it has improved over time5 Installing downloaded content  I wrote a long rant about how annoying this was but as of the most recent update you can buy items in the store and they download and install automatically as they should6 Digital Content 10 back has a 50 minimum and I feel that its high  For every 50 in digital content you get a 5 credit  If you spend 65 on digital content then you still get 5 until you spend another 35 to get it to 100  You go to a separate website using your computer and log in and then copy the code onto a piece of paper  Then you go to your wii u and put in the code  Ive become accustomed to the process and Ive decided its not very restrictive but I still wish that credits just appeared in your account 2448 hours later  The codes are good until 2015  The codes remain on that website even after youve used them they dont disappear  When you add the codes to the eShop there is no expiration dateOk now that Im done complainingYour decision matrix1 If you still like playing on your Wii and you have the money to spend buy a Wii U and sell your Wii  Youll enjoy it2 If you are considering between an XboxKinect and a Wii U I think its a tough call  I really like the second screen gaming it really opens up a lot of possibilities  But most of the wii U stuff looks really juvenile  The kid down the street told me he still wanted an Xbox because the Xbox has games for teenagers  I said whatev3 As a side note every kid who has seen and played our Wii U in the last two weeks has put this as the top item on the Christmas list  Its the next big thing for them and you can be sure that the little things that I complain about in this review wont matter to them  Not at allGames  Nintendo now has decent amount of digital content to buy online  I paid 35 for kirbys great adventure or something like that  Its a grainy looking old game but it was only thirty five cents  Nintendo has started offering games at the 2 5 and 8 price points as well  Im VERY pleased to see this because I want to be able to log into the shop and grab a game for cheap when I want toI rate this item 3 stars out of 5 because three stars means its ok  Nintendo has made a lot of improvements in 6 months and while they have fixed most of the problems with the system I find myself reluctant to raise the review to 4 stars until some more exclusive games are released  Pikmin 3 has been delayed until August for example1 month UPDATEWeve become heavy users of the Wii U  My wife who always preferred the Kinect has started to warm up to the Wii U  But I think its because my son is converting her I sure couldntBig negative CRADLE and battery have limitations The battery on the video controller cant hold up to extended play  I picked up one of these cablesGlobal Game Gear GGG0040 Deluxe Split Extension Cable for Wii U Video Controllerwhich resolved my problems  Now its easier to keep the video controller charged  Ive removed my rant about the video controller battery not lastingDOWNLOADS  I removed my rant about problems with downloads because its been fixedThe Wii U is getting better  I think it may turn into my favorite console of all time if they can just get some good exclusive games out and improve the use of the video controller in those games  I really dont want another game where the Wii U video controller shows a map  Gimmie a break,3.0,A big enough upgrade from the old Wii,1354060800,"11 28, 2012",3

population to not only war but to tsunamis earthquakes and a plague that would have entirely wiped out humanity had the Triune Goddess Morrigunia not interceded Floods and earthquakes have reduced the size of what used to be the United States by half The people exist now in a futuristic old west in which the large cities and their machinery of old lie in ruin In what had been the vast Midwest the Southwest and Southeast the land has been divided into territories ruled by the High Council of Shadowlords  three powerful psychics from far beyond the Terran galaxy Rogue reapers called Balgairs have been turned loose by the alien Ceannus to destroy the humans of Terra To eradicate them before this happens the High Council has brought in seven of Morrigunias ReapersReapers are forces to be reckoned with Tall blackhaired and inordinately handsome and wellbuilt these men each possess a symbiotic worm that gives them the strength of 10 normal men Neither vampire nor werewolf but a combination of both they can shapeshift into both a wolf and a bird Their senses are enhanced and they have powers to mesmerize and do all manner of magical things Tough unsympathetic killers theyll melt your heart with the loneliness and despair they hide from the world but cannot hide from the women destined to be their mates Ultimately they are the final word of law in the Territories and nothing is more important to them than the protection of their people Yet the people theyve dedicated their lives to protecting fear these solitary blooddrinking Reapers nearly as much as they fear the bloodthirsty RoguesAs a result of the torture and maiming he endured during his last mission Reaper Owen Tohre has taken a leave of absence from his duties But he isnt coming to terms like hed hoped with the man he is now one that may not be able to function sexually as a man ever again To deal with his nightmares and inability to sleep hes abusing Tenerse the powerful drug all Reapers must take daily to keep from transitioning out of cycle into their wolf form As a result of his drug abuse Owen is blacking out and hallucinating And hes too weak to saddle his own horseDelirious he finds himself riding near the international border between the Wismin Territory of Serenia and the Manontaque Province of the Northmen Cadre when he hears a young boy yelling for help Its second nature for Owen to respond but after pulling the child from a lake he goes into seizures so violent he nearly dies When he awakens in a strange place inhabited by a strict Communalist Colony of stern abusive men and their subservient women he finds himself acting rude and sexually aggressive with his lovely violeteyed nurse  altogether out of character for the wellmannered OwenRachel Lawrence has never met a man like the Reaper a man who speaks frankly of his sexual desire for her Ashamed of the fact she realizes she wants him too Against the backdrop of evil Drochtaacuteirs killing the Colonys people and then raising them from the dead to terrorize the living the news of what Owen and Rachel have done together in the seclusion of his sick room reaches the ears of High Elder Chamberlain Behind Owens back Rachel is punished and cast out of the Colonyliterally dead to them all What the elders dont count on is Owens love for Rachel his mate and his determination to save her Unfortunately what he must barter away to save her life will plague the couple for all their time togetherOf all Charlotte BoyettCompos Reaper series the exciting and emotionally stirring WesternWind series is one of my top two favorites The combination of the futuristic flavor mixed with old west gunslingers dressed all in black with laser whips and sixshooters and paranormal vampire werewolf elements truly makes for fascinating tales Tears of the Reaper book four in the series is my absolute series favorite with book one WyndRiver Sinner coming in a close second Though all the books in the series have a dark fantasy flavor Tears of the Reaper has a number of disturbing scenes of violence against Rachel that tear the heart out and will make you mad as hell so be prepared As always the sex scenes are sensual creating a loving connection between Rachel and Owen The secondary characters most having been seen in the previous three books are as threedimensional as everThis book also displays Ms BoyettCompos unique ability to present both the strengths and weaknesses of her characters Everyone whos read the series know what awful thing happened to Owen in book 3 Prime Reaper As a result hes experiencing what we know as PTSD Hes in considerable emotional pain and finding his memories of his torture too difficult to live with without the numbing aid of more and more Tenerse until he finds himself suffering the effects of Tenerse poisoning His story is harrowing and poignant and even as he recovers from his poisoning life continues to hand him one emotionally painful consequence after another But through it all he finds a love so strong it makes the pain and what he has to give up to save Rachel bearable and worthwhileAlthough this book can stand alone I highly recommend reading this series in order As each Reapers character building continues from book to book much of Owens back story can be found in Prime Reaper Likewise much of Ms BoyettCompos underlying world building is better understood as she builds upon it throughout her highly imaginative story arc  This review belongs in its entirety to TwoLips Reviews,5.0,A Recommended Read at TwoLips Reviews,1360281600,"02 8,

A1VPXCFO261VWH,B009AMY2TE,Rebecca Graf,"[1, 1]",Okay Its about vampires but the good news is that Carrie Pulkinen creates a unique take on the vampire stories in her book ReawakenedJules is a regular woman who has had a hard life but nothing extremely extraordinary until she meets Ian His Scottish accent is enough to make any woman swoon but there is something more Something about him seems off yet just right Hes a vampire but claims to be much more than that for her and her alone The next thing you know her life is turned upside down and memories surface that have been suppressed that will help save her and her daughters lifeI love it when an author can take something that is common such as the vampire stories and almost overly done like the vampire stories and come up with something new and refreshing Carrie Pulkinen has done just that In fact though Ian is a vampire that is not the focus of the story and I like that There is so much more to this which makes it an enjoyable readThe pace is relatively fast but not too much You can easily set the book down and pick it right back up where you left off without breaking a sweat The plot is very well done with several twists and turns A few of them even caught me off guardThere was some confusion at one point in the story as things began to unravel and be revealed I cant say too much in the details as it would be a spoiler but I had to read a few sections over again and some details were still not clear There were also some language in it though it was very minor The sex was extremely limited though there were many extremely hot scenes that were just a taste of what was to comeAn enjoyable read that I recommendNote This book was provided as part of a book tour with no expectation of a positive review,4.0,Another Unique Look at Vampires,1353888000,"11 26, 2012",4

A10WKHGNMX5VTX,B009VSVWHW,Melanie Marshall Scattered Thoughts and Rogu,"[2, 2]",Another review by Rating 5 starsWhen ex con Jeremy Stillson ends up begging for money on a street corner in Boulder Colorado he has no idea that his life is about to change when he spies the looming figure of Rance Crawford heading towards him from the nearby yarn shop  Instead of money Rance offers him a job that comes with a small room to call his own in the alpaca barn and fiber mill that Rance owns  Here is the chance Jeremy has wanted a way to be honest and to go straight leaving the illegal lifestyle behind that he learned from his conman of a father a father who died when a con went badBut living a honest life doesnt necessarily mean Jeremys past is gone with the old lifestyle  Rance turns Jeremys training over to a young gorgeous man named Aiden a master at colors and yarn dyes even as a teenager  Aiden is everything Jeremy has always wanted to be and Jeremy idolizes the teenager from the first moment they meet Year after year Jeremy slowly adjusts He learns to love his new life he learns how to knit and gains a family with the people he works with at the alpaca ranch  And most importantly he falls in love with Aiden as Aiden ages and matures into a wonderful young manJeremys feelings of insecurity and low self esteem have never gone away and when Aiden starts to return his affection Jeremy is petrified Jeremys first instincts are to run rabbit away but Aiden has Jeremy figured out  When Aiden first met Jeremy one of the things he  taught him was how to hold a angora rabbit to make it feel secure so it can be petted and brushed So when Jeremy shows signs of rabbiting away Aiden knows exactly what he has to do to keep the one man he has wanted from running away and make him trust in AidenWhat a wonderful story  I will be the first to admit that Amy Lane is a go to author for me  An Amy Lane book to me means an outpouring of human emotions from characters so real I expect to meet them on the streets An Amy Lane story means that the situations and events her characters find themselves entangled in comes across so authentic so genuine that not only my empathy but my heart is engaged from the very beginning  If they weep then I find myself sobbing along as well  And when they find joy then my heart feels replete with happinessHow To Raise An Honest Rabbit Knitting 3 brings back the characters we learned to love in The Winter Courtship Rituals of FurBearing Critters Knitting  1  Present and accounted for are Rance Crawford owner of the alpaca farm and yarn mill Ben McCutcheon Rances lover and neighbor Aiden fabric designer extraordinaire and Ariadne shop manager and spinner and of course Jeremy  The first story in the Knitting series gave us Rance and Bens courtship from their POV with the other characters circling around like satellites albeit family member satellites  And as much as we learned to love Ariadne and Rory her husband it was Jeremy and Aiden we kept returning to and we wanted to know their stories too And thankfully Amy Lane gives us that and more in How To Raise An Honest RabbitIt was hysterical to see Rance and Bens meeting and courtship from the other side so to speak as Rances meeting with Jeremy predates Ben moving in next door But the heart of this story is Jeremy his pain born out of his past and his slow emergence into the man he wanted to be but never thought possible  Jeremys history is heartbreaking in that Amy Lane way which means the angst of his past is brought vividly home to the reader but in small subtle ways that build over the length of the story into a horrific portrait of a young boy lost to society at the earliest of ages  We learn in tiny increments about the jars of peanut butter Jeremy has stashed so he always has something to eat and the true reason he talks so much yet values silence and the awful fact that Jeremy doesnt even know his real name The story is told from Jeremys POV which is so important as we hear his thoughts about his life his panic attacks his growing affection for Aiden and everyone else around himAnd as we learn about Jeremy we are also creating a strong picture of Aiden as well  From Aidens interaction with Rance overheard conversations and his talks with Jeremy we watch a young fiber genius mature into a man who realizes that patience and perhaps ear plugs are the way to capture the skittish man he has fallen in love with  It was Aidens careful loving interactions with Jeremy that made me fall in love with Aiden completely And with Ariadne as well Really there is just an endless stream of gems that I could be quoting from the story but that would take away some of the magic to be found from discovering them on your own as I didAnd finally as a knitter myself I loved every aspect of knitting that appears here from the carding machines noise to the method Ariadne used to  teach Jeremy to knit and his own rhyme he made up  There are the dye vats color cards and descriptions of how the same colored strands can be spun in different manner ending up as completely different yarns  And I dont think you have to be a knitter to find all this information fascinating it just is  But did I love the patterns for the fingerless mittens at the end  Why yes I did and will try my hand at making a set this winterThere is another Knitting series book on the horizon Knitter in his Natural Habitat Knitting 4 Johnny and Stanleys story  I cant wait In the meantime I will just shuffle off and reload Winter Courtship Rituals back onto my Kindle and start from the beginning once more as I waitHere is the order the books were written and should be readThe Winter Courtship of Fur Bearing Critters Knitting 1Super Sock Man Knitting

actually friends with Gina Maxwell Now making that statement isnt one of those 8216oh aren8217t I special8217 things It just needed to be said before I let my thoughts regarding the latest installment

at itIf you8217ve had the privilege of reading Seducing Cinderella or Rules of Entanglement you know this Her heroes are strong and sexy and her heroines are actually likable This is a huge thing for me when it comes to romance because nothing puts a sour taste in my mouth quite like a milquetoast woman that swoons just because the hero says she should I knew that when it came time for book number

didn8217t doubt that she could pull it off not in the least Gina is one of those authors that labors over every word she writes Every syllable has meaning What I was worried about was actually reading

and he goes above and beyond to protect her To save her life Irish does the one thing he swore he would never do again fightAs the hero is based on the obnoxiously aesthetically pleasing Adam Von Rothfelder picturing Irish was easypeasy but what makes the character quite literally the sexiest man I8217ve ever seen on paper is his attitudeNo one ever asks to fall in love with someone that has more baggage than a Kardashian and when Irish discovers the abuse that Kat has survived the reader literally sees him switch gears A man that was once interested in keeping her safe and maybe engaging in some horizontal action does everything in his power to bring Kat out of the shadows It no longer becomes about him and his needs Yes there is sex in this book Oh mother is there sex and it melts panties and possibly whatever surface you are sitting on it is so hot but every interaction is meaningful Every single solitary lick and touch is Irish8217s way of showing Kat that not every man will hurt her and that sex can be about her Not the person that8217s using her but actually her The dialogue between the two of them is scintillating and refreshing It isnt just 34Hey my dick is hard and you know you want me to place it somewhere in your person34 Theres actual conversation Real meaningful everyday people working their way over a hurdle together conversation The tenderness between these characters is unbelievableWhat is more magical about this book is that Gina captures Kat8217s journey from broken to beautiful in the most glorious way The reader will actually watch her transform and the only word that I can use to describe it is autobiographical There were entire paragraphs from Kat8217s point of view during which I had to put the book down and take a deep breath because I felt like I was reading a diary It hurt but it was the best kind of hurt because it was illuminating Abuse survivors run the gamut of emotions and one of the most damaging is their willingness to blame themselves for the bad things that happened to them Kat morphs from a terrified caterpillar in an iron cocoon to the most spectacular butterflyFighting for Irish is the kind of book everyone deserves to read There is joy there is pain There is sex Did I mention the sex Ducttape your ears shut because your brain may possibly melt and trickle out It8217s that goodI8217ve used a plethora of words in this review but really the only ones that count are these this book is spectacular Gina8217s readers and anyone who loves Alphas with huge heart will now have a new favorite in their library Were this book not already perfect I would love it simply because of the dedication Gina dedicates it to victims of sexual abuse encouraging them to never stop fightingThis book is a manifesto giving the broken a glimpse to that someday when if they keep fighting and never loose hope their Irish will happen tooless,5.0,Heatbreakingly gorgeous,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",4

A1FEBL7652SEPS,B004SYA76Q,Jennifer Scarpa Jenn of Frequent Reader Inf,"[1, 2]",RECEIVED FROM The Author For ReviewNOTE MY REVIEWS OFTEN CONTAIN SPOILERSMarina is about to start her senior year of high school in a new school the first shes ever actually attended and for the first time without her Dad there to support her  Marinas father is a agronomist whos spending the year in Afghanistan to help them develops ways to feed their country while Marina is going to Aptos California to live with her Aunt Abby and her cousin Cruz in their little seaside town  She believes her life is over until she encounters a sexy boy named Ethan and an ethereal mermaid name Lorelei  Soon shes drawn into the little seaside town and the mysteries of the ocean it borders embarking on a dangerous quest to find out who she is and where she comes from  Will she survive to discover the answers she seeksThe summary isnt the best description of the book but lately I seem to find myself staring at a blank screen forever just to try to find the right words to both summarize and review the books Ive read  I dont know if its having a blog thats creating this loss for words in my writing or just some temporary mental block but hopefully it goes away soon  Anyway back to the reviewThis book is really more of a 35 stars than 3 but I dont do half ratings since I copy my reviews to my different profiles its easier to stay with solid stars since thats what the other sites use  I actually only found two things that I think detracted from what is an otherwise well written and interesting story however one of them was just so big that it dropped my rating considerablyThe first thing that bothered me and this is actually the smaller one was that the characters seemed to have this inside joke that was never explained to the reader  Theres multiple scenes with giggling characters where I didnt really understand what was so funny  To the characters in this novel theres apparently something hilarious about the statement Thats what she said  I didnt get it and theres nothing worse than being on the outside of a joke Okay well there is but it still sucks when youre left outThe thing that I thought was the major flaw with this book was the Mary Sue tendencies of the characters and their lifestyles  They werent quite perfect but they were darn close at first I wasnt going to ding this book so hard for this but it was her father winning the Nobel prize that kind of put it over the top for me  Marina has traveled extensively attending online school because her father is not only a brilliant agronomist a job that to be honest Id never heard of before reading this book but also holds a faculty position at a prestigious university  Apparently hes powerful enough that Marina can get her own way on all her classes just by mentioning his name to the school guidance counselorShe herself is brilliant and is only attending high school because her father feels shes too independent and needs to learn to be around her peers Its pretty apparent that no one really expects her to learn anything new academically there  Lets not forget thats shes beautiful and mystical as wellHer neighbor whos pretty much adopted her to the point shes referred to as Aunt Evie is a retired fashion model who dresses Marina is Prada and other top of the line designers just because she enjoys doing it  If that werent enough with this flamboyant character she has a basement full of expensive cars that she lets Marina learn to drive on and oh shes the original fashion it girl  Not to mention the fabulous Evie spends her time searching out hidden talents in fashion and music and helping them succeed in the business  I seriously need an Aunt EvieHer cousin Cruz though a social outcast is a brilliant but as of yet undiscovered fashion designer  His best friend Meghan is a song writer with the most amazing voice  And we cant forget that Evan the boy who falls for Marina is the hottest and most respect guy in school  Hes the best surfer on the beach works all the time to achieve his future and adores the perfect MarinaI had planned to mention this from about the introduction of Aunt Evie but I hadnt planned to make as big of a deal of it in my review until Dad won the Nobel prize  Thats just what put it over the top for me  The only negative things really in the characters lives is that Ethan doesnt have a lot of money and his mother ran off when he was only a kid  Cruz is a social outcast and believe his father died in a car crash when he was a baby only to learn later that his father was a married man who tried paying his mother to abort him  Meghan is overweight and also a social outcast  And finishing out the social outcast crew is Marina whos mother died in child birth Its as if the writer has found a couple flaws she likes and just attributed them to every characterThe book however is extremely well written fast paced and a quick and enjoyable read  The plot has some interesting twists and turns that keep readers turning the page  The only thing I think the writer needs to learn is that perfect characters may lead wonderful lives but its harder for a reader to relate to characters whose lives they envy than a characters who has just as many issues as they do  Overall though I really did enjoy reading this book and I would recommend it to others who enjoy young adult urban fantasy novels  Its an excellent debut novel from a writer I look forward to reading more of  Theres an obvious talent in the writing and the ability to weave a page turning story  I only hope that the characters become a little more believable in future works,3.0,Well Written Story Intriguing Plot,1309046400,"06 26, 2011",4

AMD046Z4S0QSO,B00DPYZZXA,Jade,"[0, 0]",Disclaimer I received this book from the author as part of a R2R in the Lovers of Paranormal Goodreads group This doesnt affect my review and the following is my honest opinionI started Before Midnight knowing it was inspired by the story of Cinderella And looking forward to a retelling of the fairy tale so unlike some other reviewers it was actually the prologue that caught me off guard I knew the series was interconnected but the way that Jennifer Blackstream chose to do so has me very intrigued From the first sentence I was surprised  in a very good way  and the initial intrigue had me devouring the book itselfAnd Cinderella meets werewolves Sounds like a delicious combination to meThe story of Loupe and Etienne shares some of the themes of the original Cinderella and while I feel like it could have been fine without them I loved the idea of the ball and the twist Ms Blackstream put on the slipper I thought it was a very creative idea and retelling that was never predictable The characters she created are intriguing I am itching to know more about the other princes in the prologue and both Etienne and Loupe were dynamic in their own ways You might argue that Loupe was timid and weak but I felt that the growth and development for her was logical and made sense considering her upbringing and history She is a kind woman and what can I say Im a sucker for puppies and her empathy for them had me smiling And a handsome prince playing with cute little animals Extra points for the adorable On the subject of  Etienne he was a very interesting prince I have a weakness for werewolves and Ms Blackstream put a very fun spin on them with her first prince His dual nature and his struggle to handle his emotions as a human left me wanting to know more of himMy only gripes are that it wasnt long enough which in several parts made it feel a little rushed I wanted more of them both and more background to it all Some of the scenes and some of the characters would have in my opinion benefited from more time on the page Loupes stepmother had me wondering Id have liked to know just how she and Loupes father ended up together or more of where she comes from My hope is that as the series builds we might have some answers to questions Im left ponderingOverall though it was a great read A fun story with characters that interested me and left me hoping to see them again  even if only in brief snippets in later books I recommend it it was worth the read,4.0,Fun fast paced spin on Cinderella,1399939200,"05 13, 2014",4
