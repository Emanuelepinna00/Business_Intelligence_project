88,A8QCB68UL50NX,B000025558,might fall love kid maybe a love hate it album unconditionally recommend giving it least one try especially youre a fan ok computer or hail thiefwhy kid a radioheads true masterpiece thats right even ok computer it take the rulebook and rip it clean in two managing to so many different thing in so many way it almost indescribable thus review really wind a short guide to listening to kid a a trackbytrack overview to give the reader concept of experiencing the album feel likehow to listen to kid a expect the unexpectedas many shocked listener discovered kid a released it is ok computer it is a radiohead album make mistake but it sound like nothing youve ever heard in a good way a favor and leave concept of what you might hear at the door form experience of what you hear and allow yourself to be startled it it ok the water warm listen to the entire albumat least kid a flow more than any previous radiohead work it supposed to be experienced a single cohesive whole the possible break being treefingers act a intermission of sort it shorter than ok computer you can do it set aside minute and do the album justice give it timekid a is an album that absolutely refuse to give everything up first listen youll need to engage it actively if you want to enjoy it completely music always to be work no but in this case it well worth the troubletrack by tracknote this is still unsure that will like the album and are skittish making the initial investment it a brief overview done mostly for own pleasure expect spoiler everything in it right placethis is actually a typical radiohead opener in it own way completely different the rest of the album it nevertheless launch you instantly the proper context for hearing everything else beginning with a single synth line that ascends upwards towards an uneasy apprehensive standoff that somehow reminds of thus spake zarathrustra the listener then encounter the first new element on this album thoms vocal track put a blender then reconstituted into something thats part human part jigsaw puzzle a hackedup bit of sound are dubbed the normal vocal there an odd sense of tension and stasis it the traumatic shock in the immediate aftermath of a great tragedy and thom cant find the word to describe it a the tension and volume build the mangled track multiplying the song suddenly resolve into the synth line with which it began adding some modulationpitch bending in the right channel the track is both calming and disturbing two seemingly opposing trait that will continue to mingle throughout the album kid athe title track open with a sound like a ufo slowly coming to hover the ground only to be replaced by a nurseryrhyme melody played on what could be tubular bell this mix of the earthly and unearthly is what defines the song when deep reverbladen synths and muted ish bass drum kick in the effect is something like being transported back to the womb only to find it completely alien the vocal have once been altered this time strained through a distorted vocoder that make sound like a cross an old analog recording and some extraterrestrial along the line of et the song is almost lulling and comforting except for some odd squeak that sound like dissipating air and one single jarringly dissonant sample in the middle carefully calculated to throw the listener hisher guard then a the song sound it innocent and hopeful a sample fade in of a baby cry which in turn crossfades to a single eerie highpitched note this is counterbalanced by a guttural synth sound that lead directly into the next track the national anthemthis is the album begin to sound slightly more like traditional radiohead that is the brass section enters it begin with a simple antagonistic bassline gradually adding drum odd sample ambient noise a highpitched synth and a brief vocal track then of nowhere a low brass rhythym enters eventually rising into squalling trumpet and finally a chorus of different brass instrument playing in different key at different time imagine john coltrane mile davis charles mingus and a number of notable brass soloist blasting away at the same time on respective instrument without any regard for what one another is playing and you begin to get the idea the track is eaten alive by the brass section only to briefly echo in a distorted orchestral arrangement that end on a minor chord setting the stage for the album early climax to disappear completelythose who study radiohead will notice a pattern emerging the fourth track is always a slow haunting ballad which usually wind up being one of the album most powerful track how to disappear completely is the culmination of a number of study in creepily beautiful ballad it begin with almost inaudible string playing an unresolved minor key almost subconsciously setting your teeth on edge gradually an arrhythmic acoustic guitar fade in meandering minor progression which heighten the uneasy mood thom enters quietly in the lower part of falsetto range a heartstopping downward glissando provoke palpitation im not herethis isnt happening sings quietly from the track slowly crescendo by turn achingly beautiful heartrending and nervewracking it equal part crisis and catharsis revelling and worrying over one terrible moment if kid a is a yorke put it something traumatic then this is the definitive moment of trauma all those who accuse kid a of being inhuman listen carefully radiohead have never been more fully committed spiritually and emotionally than in this song treefingersafter the intense ordeal of the last two song the listener is confronted with long rounded synthlike sound actually played on guitar then cutandpasted in postproduction it reminds me of sunlight glinting through the branch of underwater tree kelp or coral i dont know yet even this ambient work so soothing is slightly troubling a well in the end treefingers serf a a fullstop a brief intermission between first and second act a chance for the listener to catch hisher breath optimisticthis track is a somewhat startling jolt the ambient nature of the last one the listener is immediately launched into the most satisfyingly normal song on the album if anything sound like ok computer on kid a this is it specifically it the best part of electioneering rearranged to form an even more biting and sarcastic song try the best you cantry the best you canthe best you can is good enough thom taunt sardonically after commenting on how the big fish eat the little one it the bitter medicine to the everyone is special method of child rearing that ha infected the world today the track is mostly powered by the fivepiece guitardriven dynamic that made radiohead famous although towards the ending it dissolve towards an interesting jam with jazzrock tendency it end with a crash cymbal segueing directly into the next track in limboafter a brief stuttering synth intro tumbling drum and unsettling guitar arpeggio set up a chaotic composition the vocal wailed over these tide of instrumentation only increase the feeling of unease this wa one of the most disturbing song on the album for me between the creepy intonation youre living in a fantasy world reminiscent of the dream on line from the film jacob ladder and the howl of go away that are distorted into meaninglessness at the song end it pretty frightening idiotequecombine a moody ambient synth with stuttering aphex twin beat and challenging vocal and you have the ultimate feelbad antidance electronic track given all that idioteque is still pretty entertaining and surprisingly singabledanceable some bit in it own morbid apocalyptic way one could spend age simply dissecting the intricacy of the squeak and scratch that form the song beat the lyric are mostly oblique although some say that they deal with the threat of global warming the only thing thats really clear is that this song is the foretelling of the inevitable apocalypse that give the album it name kid a is the term for the first child born after an apocalyptic event the track end on a prolonged dissonant chord which dissolve into the next song morning bellif you oversimplified kid a down to just a concept album with the title track representing birth how to disappear completely representing teenage year optimistic being the greedy beginning of adulthood and idioteque being the concerned year of middle age then this song would most likely deal with the central character old age or senility thats not to say that it sound aged or senile it just seems to express the ramblings of a senile mind between the disjointed nonsensical lyric mumbled by yorke in a nervous falsetto whisper the shredded guitar peal in the background and the splintered drum there a general impression of disorder briefly shattered by a sudden crescendo halfway through the song where suddenly all the disparate element of the song seem united in a single purpose only to evaporate back towards minimalist unrest finally fading to just a synth chord and a groping muted bassline motion picture soundtrackkid a grand finale start with just an old organ pumping away at chord that sound older and wiser than time the vocal come slowly patiently heartbreaking in their steady intensity i think youre crazy thom sings in a manner that sound like anything but disapproval there a brief measure of rest then unearthly sound like a child toy or an alien spaceship trickle upwards and downwards over the vocal track eventually supplemented by an equally ethereal operatic voice rising upwards into oblivion to some it may be slightly reminiscent of the soundtrack at the end of the elephant man it drive me to tear almost every time i listen to it the unlikely duet straining upwards towards the heaven a thom sings i will see you in the next life the tinkling jackintheboxlike instrument then slide from the top to the bottom of it range before spiraling off in random tangent slowling fading into silencethis silence last for roughly a minute before it slowly fade into feedback replaced by the sound of string tuning and the lift of an enormous choir collapsing into cheerful electronic beep perhaps this is the next life of which yorke sings if so only glimpse it for thirty second before there are two more minute of silence and the album repeat,5,1,23,22,2006,4,16,2,2006-04-16

110,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B0002KQOG2,come band van halen may the minority when i say i feel became better band when sammy hagar brought in to replace david lee roth the lead vocalist when it come to showmanship david lee roth would be a tough act to follow however sammy hagar brought something else to the table the allaround quality musicianship it wa that musicianship that elevated van halen to even greater height of creativity it wa that musicianship that could be replaced when gary cherone wa later brought van halen to replace hagar i subscribe to the notion that sometimes the best thing a mature band to bring in outsider to join the band it give the band fresh idea a new perspective i look the case of the rolling stone bringing ron wood in ron wood much play bass became a significant contributor to the band to sammy hagar like not injected new life into the van halen band and became a significant contributor much like wood did for the stone hagar doesnt sing hell contribute to the songwriting and production of the effort of van halen like ron wood sammy hagar already proven to be an accomplished musician album sammy hagar the essential red collection provides great insight into not just sammys pre van halen day sammys entire career outside of van halenone thing that amazes me is that the essential red collection is a single cd of track comprising minute of music certainly going to get value this cd for the part the essential red collection is going to focus on sammys and s solo career it also contains some of the soundtrack work that sammy done are also two unreleased track and a track he did previous band montroseit is also worth noting there are compilation there when considering the essential red collection it probably pay to compare and contrast this ha to offerrematch this wa a greatest hit compilation that wa released in it contain song that are on the essential red collection red ive done everything for you and a live version of montroses bad motor scooter it also contains a lot of hagars s work that is not included on the essential red collection album a nine on a ten scale musical chair and street machine are not represented on the essential red collection but are found on this collectionbest of sammy hagar capital record released in this is another collection that compliment the essential red collection the same three song overlap this collection that overlap rematch red ive done everything for you and bad motor scooter this cover sammys work while with capital record moving to geffen record the big difference this best of and rematch is that best of includes sammys cover of otis redding sittin on the dock of the bay sadly this cover wa omitted the essential red collectionunboxed this collection wa released in and cover sammys work with geffen record there is overlap between unboxed and the two capital record compilation rematch and best of most of the song on unboxed are included on the essential red collection the four song that are not included on the essential red collection are buying way into heaven baby on fire three lock box and i dont need lovedespite many of the song that are in some of older compilation that arent included the essential red collection brings some unique thing it is the sammy hagar compilation that bridge his capital record work with his geffen record work it is the only collection that includes soundtrack work that sammy ha done fast time at ridgemont high title song the girl get around from footloose and the winner take it from the top it includes two unreleased track from the early s thinking of you and call my name it includes three song from his s work little white lie marching to mar and ma tequilaone thing i like is when a greatest hit collection arranges track in chronological order this allows me to see the artist ha progressed over time even though there are some gap in the essential red collection sammys late s work and his van halen day it is still a good thing that the track arranged chronologically this still give some sense of how sammys career ha evolvedmost importantly though the essential red collection truly entertain you of the track doe a great job at showcasing sammys talent this reaffirmed my theory that it wa sammy hagar that took a group like van halen to the next levelthe liner note truly justice to this compilation in addition to the cd packaged in a unique red tinted jewel case there are lot of extra ted nugent writes some introductory word scott schinder writes a terrific biographical sketch of hagar focusing on his solo career finally each of the track are listed with songwriter mostly hagar production credit and most importantly what album each of the song came from overall this is a terrific snapshot of hagars career you arent familiar with his work outside of van halen this is the collection to get you always compliment it with the rematch or best of collection to get some of the earlier work the only negative i can think of his the exclusion of sittin on the dock of the bay otherwise a highly recommended collection,5,1,3,3,2005,7,19,2,2005-07-19

167,A262TFY27XMQS3,B000000IRB,dark side moon pink floyds eighth studio albumthere never never band quite like pink floyd extensive career the prog rock quartet of dave gilmour guitar roger water bass rick wright keyboard and nick mason drum made a legendary contribution rock music ive also forgotten original frontman syd barratt list the band tried their fair share of new idea and in many way paved the way in pushing the boundary of music of the band album quite popular none more than dark side of the moon heralded the floyds greatest work and one of the greatest album of all time album ha shifted more unit than rock album ever made sale are over million unit think so is this album really deserving of great popularity and also is that bit specialfor is question this is pink floyds ultradefinitive album and also their finest album other hardcore floyd fan may disagree and choose wish the wall preference but i think that this top pink floyd to this point amazingly demonstrated their great potential none more so than in their great release meddle that album you could sense that the band were the brink of producing a true masterpiece and here you have it the ultimate masterpiece the band in dark side of the moon everything come together on this album the song run cohesively and perfectly from one to the next and the songwriting is literally awesome it come a no surprise that all of the band member had songwriting input on the album rather than the sole water dominance that would come in later album and this demonstrates why this album is so good it often amazes me that there are people around today are more than willing to bash this album i constantly hear comment a it sound dated or this music make me fall asleep people probably listener to senseless nu metal emo crap or anything else thats abysmal in music in recent time never fail to amaze me i dont know stuff must be on to make them so diluded last check this album made over year ago yes year people are quick to dis the technique that pink floyd used on this album to make various effect but at the time it wa completely new and revolutionary they didnt have the latest digital recording studio to help them out that aside the various style the band use on the album me still sound fantastic and fresh gilmours guitar work is first rate a are vocal water bass play is beautifully resonant throughout and the keyboard work by wright is fantastic with that all aside it is the lyrical concept that really make this album so good pink floyd take you amazing conceptual journey on this album and one that you never tire of the all realisitic theme of loss of time war madness and death are in this album the band tackle a whole load of theme in this minute album you cant not be emotionally moved by it this is why the album ha appealed to so many over time the album concept driven experimental but ultimately polished and structured style is what make it shine so much the album ha so many side to it and you notice something new with every listen who also could miss the cover the prism effect front is simple but an amazing eyecatcherthe journey of the dark side of the moon begin with opener speak to mebreathe the opening part of the song open up with a showcase of the effect to come mad voice a woman screaming cash till and everything else all cleverly mix together note all the voice you hear on the album were worker at the recording studio who had their reponses recorded they were asked madness this run the start of the proper music firstly with the classic guitar and bass line for the album followed by a couple of verse of harsh and brutal lyric on the run is a clever track with a racing electronic sound which wa created by speeding a note sequence on a tape loop there plenty more effect added in on this track then come to the album first epic in time a surpise entrance of ringing bell kick start this one gilmours crunching guitar chord alongside echoing drumming give this song an atmospheric build up this then becomes a lyrically amazing song with theme on time slipping away and growing old gilmours guitar solo is brilliant a is the breathe reprise song exit following this great track is the closing song for side one with great gig in the sky rick wright gentle piano chord are superbly contrasted by the passionate emotional and evocative wail by singer clair torry who the band hired for the song the song is like nothing ive heard beforethe second half of the album open with the album famous song who could fail to recognise the unique cashmachine sound at the start of the song rhythmically this song is weird a it is written in time a opposed to the standard however this time signature pave the way for the song classic bass line the lyric based around corporate wealth greed and acquisition are classic a is the middle section with plenty of roaring guitar u and them follows perhaps the album most heartfelt song based on the theme of outrage at the continuation of the vietnam war this song is powerful the keyboard work is imaginitive and the saxophone solo is brilliant any colour you like is next this one is experimental gilmour try his hand at some quirky guitar play over some great keyboard dub the madness theme of brain damage is next up which look at the mental damage caused to war casualty this is another foreboding song with a brutal and realistic edge finally to close this epic album is eclipse a short punchy finish with plenty of contrasting lyric building to a climax the heartbeat at the end cleverly trail the album to a finish in the style just like it begandark side of the moon is an epic musical journey through the tragedy of life pink floyd were at their absolute peak with this album and the work is never short of inspired moment this album is perfect everything come together both musically and lyrically plenty of people have this album but still you dont then this is a must buy this album is not just the place

290,A2SX3DN3T0U7I1,B000056W06,profoundly impressed first exposure nightwish via oceanborn next step to immediately procure next three release obviously right wa really curious to hear wishmaster since seems to difference opinion it seems to inspire ambivalence lack of enthusiasm some sometimes seems to grade lower nightwish cdsi reaction i absolutely loved it the start and it probably end time favorite like top my impression well everything i could want in music power beauty passion memorable melody rhythmic drive vibrantpositivelifeaffirming attitude all there to me wishmaster come classic melodic metal it somewhat reminiscent of vintage iron maiden a opposed to the dream theatre type progressive vibe of oceanborn or the heavier more modern flavor of century child and to suggest nightwish derivative without doubt a strong character all of their comparison a rough frame of referencewishmaster is more guitar driven than oceanborn a bit le grandiose and not quite a bold or dramatic it also noticeably more polished there arent really clunky element in the music and sound quality is much better wishmaster doesnt have the harsh highfrequency issue oceanborn really help the listening experience it a balanced sound no one element dominates get a strong impression of cohesion and synergy everyone pulling together id say the vocal benefit from this ive noticed the vocal sometimes get a little lost in the mix other nightwish cd not the case hereand thats a really good thing there is any vocal performance that be highlighted it tarja turunens performance on wishmaster the word i can use is sublime im probably guilty of overusing this adjective it come to nightwish thats the only way i can really sum it up i guess gorgeous and stunning work pretty well but im sticking sublime the vocal are firmly in the classical operatic style really similar to those on oceanborn though i like classical music i never liked classical vocal ive always thought of a stuffy and selfindulgent i dont have that feeling all with tarja in contrast i just cant get enough somewhat sadly nightwish went to a more conventional vocal style following wishmaster though i think tarja is still the best heavy music singer out there even in a more conventional style the unique flavor of performance in wishmaster and oceanborn are unforgettableall this raving about the vocal performance shouldnt overshadow the other performance in wishmaster a usual nightwish is really disciplined in songwriting and arrangement there no self indulgence the song are all memorable there terrific use of melody and harmony and the playing is top notch also a usual i find it impossible to pick favorite my favorite track is whichever one im listening to at the moment i love it when a cd is consistent listen all the way take a quick break repeat repeat againin some way wishmaster isnt super original it more of a unique take on the classic metal formula you could argue that the guitar lead have all been heard operatic vocal are common on pb youve heard those chord change before and so on i think thats true of the vast majority of music out there you could make similar argument for just about any lpcd truly ground breaking effort arent that common wishmaster is not in that category if youre interested in that vibe oceanborn or century child might be better choice if youre really the heavy modern grindy sound or a bit more of a darker vibe once would be a better nightwish choicei think wishmaster will appeal most to people value melody harmony and balance in their music a opposed to those who favor heaviness or sheer guitar drive or are finicky about their metal i think that wishmaster is so strong in area that i would probably pick this a the cd that i would use to expose nonmetal fan to the music i think it transcends the genre or a one of my bros like to say it world class,5,1,23,23,2005,1,29,1,2005-01-29

495,A6FIAB28IS79,B0000047D9,lester isnt overrated widelyacclaimed recording isexcept perhaps already familiar lester followed career to this meeting with oscar highfidelity longplaying record a young teen first saw lester a jatp concert in milwaukee i remember sight a wobbly woebegone creature who blind drunk apparently clueless wa although he blew his mouthpiece a time i couldnt hear a sound and i remember his leaving the stage with help supportive musician next introduction to prez wa this recording time i acquired a generous collection of gene ammons sonny stitt album dexter gordon and johnny griffin consequently this encounter lester and oscar wa insufficient to clinch the case prez a one leg of historic triumvirate of tenor titan with hawk and trane occupying the two positionsin hawk recorded body and soul became practically an instant classic in that year lester recorded lester leap in with an expanded basie rhythm section the latter recording wa largely ignoreduntil woodys nd herd brought u the four brother and stan getz who practically channeled lester durling the last half of a ralph burn instrumental that became a bonafide hit early autumn gradually but unmistakably became increasingly clear it wa lester perhaps other musician who made many aspiring musician choose the tenor saxophone ahead of any other instrument lester had become a school unto and at a time the music wa leaving the popular limelight and the cultural mainstream in favor of an increasingly countercultural direction he wa the personification of this new alternative ultra cool music written that it wa lester who popularized this apparently ineradicable permanent addition to vocabularydespite the irresistible pulse and swing generated by this oscar peterson rhythm section i cant help but sense that lester is occasionally scrambling on his horn to keep up moreover his sound doesnt have the foundation body that is present even on his airy freefloating highregister flight on the basie recording from the late on this recording he on the cusp of sounding a trifle fragile occasionally somewhat tentative and frail in other word i find in complete disagreement with those many reviewer and critic who vehemently denounce received wisdom that lester had lost his luster in the s in devotion to lester which in might seen a testimony to his influence and attraction feel practically dutybound to challenge the customary line on lester or mythie that he wa a sensitive artist whose humiliation at the hand of racist military superior led to mental depression alcoholism and all diminished creativity and facilityto degree the evidence support their caseie that lester returned to form playing better than ever listening to lester between and is to hear a far more powerful aggressive even virtuoso saxophonist one who frequently us the lower register of the horn the lester young trio from is an especially enjoyable session with nat king cole piano accompanying and soloing a imaginatively a lesters tenor buddy rich play tastefully yet on top of the beat to a degree found on the more flawless and polished but also more predictable and le engaging benny goodman trio recording with teddy wilson and gene krupa and when get to the jatp session with a rhythm section of hank jones rich and an inaudible ray brown lester lead lester leap in with an agile imaginative solo that practically rival the ensuing burst of creativity from the alto saxophone of charlie parker ill go with the lester apologist up to this historical point even though a few may argue that following his court marshal and subsequent dishonorable discharge from military service lester abandoned some of the key principle of the cool school that he had founded rather that saying more by playing le he often seems intent on proving he up to the challenge of the beboppers even overcompensating circumstance warrant improvising that verge on the pyrotechnicali still prefer the light high freefloating sound of prez the war but thats a personal preference his mastery of his instrument is unassailableat least not at any time the first half of the last century but the question about his playing throughout the s seems far more controversial ive read that listener are attracted to billie holiday recording from the s rather than to stellar columbia recording of the s and early s it understandable that for the same reason some listener may be similarily moved by prez recording from the s performance represents a kind of victory over ironclad internal and external force each represents a shout of defiance in the face of destiny decline and mortality itself are those who defend the performance of billie and prez on the celebrated sound of jazz cbs telecast from frankly many year i find the performance of both a trifle depressing which is not the bluesfine and mellow should ever be in the same year prez wa featured at the newport jazz festival a soloist in a basie reunion concert he play both lester leap in and polka dot and moonbeam a though they his last breathwhich wa not far from the truth to my ear he sound like a musician who with plenty of liquid assistance fortified himself in order not to incur embarrassment his sound is relatively secure but it also forced calcified woodenformulaic phrase emanating from a programmed orifice you enjoy that lester youll be enthralled by the more buoyant and creative lester of this verve recording but he no longer he old lester the perpetually young hip cool lester who ultimately became the president of the tenor saxophone during the first half of the last centuryif lester failed to retain office at the beginning of the century second half it wa le a question of his keeping up with the many eager and able younger player a flock owing no small part of it existence to lesters example than of maintaining the standard he himself had created lester showed the rest of u you could be conspicuously even stubbornly different from peersan innovator a quiet yet forceful influence a creative artist always at the forefrontwithout running away to form your band playing radically original music whether in or of office prez wa one of u after many duke count king bird hawk etc finally had a creative giant who wa not royalty or some sort of nonhuman specie lester young perhaps more than any other musician in this music history epitomized a delicate balance between individualism and community that is the essence of an indigenous liberal a in changing democratic art and thats

1140,A3QL4Z0XZC08ZQ,B00009RAVM,would rate almost fan relatively quiet move air disassembled maintenance higher that star even though fan seems meet minimal requirement deserves ive rated and probably le major design flawsenergy uselow speed watt low grill rotation wattsmedium speed watt medium with grill rotation on wattshigh speed watt high with grill rotation on watt rounded to nearest watt measured killawatt ez meterenergy use note imo watt consumption on the low fan speed setting is excessive on low i would expect the fan to consume to watt the high setting is a low consumption imo other small fan i inch to inch consumed about watt more on highprosthis fan move air and that well it is reasonably quietit a removable grill on the back attached with phillips screw i assume i be able remove it to clean the blade this also allow access to the motor so i can oil the bushing havent done this yet this is the typical reason fan stop working the bushing lose lubrication time and eventually seizeif it turn that i can easily remove the blade for cleaning and disassemble to oil the bushing my rating will be revised to starthe grill on the front rotates engaged to change airflow direction to degree similar to standard fan that use a gear to rotate the entire fan head although this fan doe not have much airflow directional change this feature work it doe rattle slightly when useregardless of my minor criticism i like this feature it take le room than a standard fan when operating the fanhead doe not rotate only the front grill and i can turn this feature not wanted or if it fails also the limited directional change of airflow is adequate for my useconsthe problem is the design awful i bought this fan to mount on the wall nope doesnt work for mei not go the mental exercise of visualizing mounting this fan would work in practice i assumed the designer had thought about this since that is a major selling feature apparently didnt think muchimo the design is terrible for wall mounting several dry run i cant figure out how the design can possibly work well for anyone serious modification would be needed for my application and i draw the line defeating builtin safety featureshere is i find the design to be terriblenote that the fanhead will pivot but the pivot angle is set at degree to the fan base instead of degree or parallel to it also note that the control on the right hand side of the fan housing although this might be attractive this design interferes with the usefulness of this fan tabletop or when mounted to the point that the fan is useless to for mountingsitting on a table top the degree pivot will direct airflow a much up but not a it will sidetoside this can work on a table top can physically move the fan to get the direction wanted but is a physical stop in the housing prevents the fan pointing down at not goodas designed the fan is to be mounted on the wall with the fan rotated counterclockwise degree viewed from the front in tabletop position mounting is limited to this one orientation if that doesnt work for wall bad if that point the fan in the wrong direction the fan portion can be rotated degree within the housing but it look like it is pointing backwards which it would be not pleasingit first appeared that the mounting plate could be reversed to resolve this although they can be reversed the fan will not function when mounted this way upsidedown from the mfgs intended mount there is a safety feature on the fan automatic shutoff presumably to turn the fan off if it fall over thus the fan will not run upsidedown so i stuck with the one orientation set by the design and would need to turn the fanhead backwards to direct air where i need it a poor optionit get worse when wall mounted the design force the position of the control to be the fan blade housing with the bottom of the fan housing mounted at foot above the floor my preferred location the control would be difficult even for me to see or access the control would then be at about foot above the floor anyone shorter than i would need a ladder to reach this ontop control location can not be changed again due to the safety shutoff featurefinally when mounted the pivot remains at degree so directional adjustment of airflow becomes a compromise horizontal and vertical degree movement although this doe allow a downward component it still doe not work well in my proposed application a galley kitchenmounting would not be easy either there is no access through the plastic foot to attach the mounting plate to the wall attaching it firmly to the wall to limit vibrationnoise would also be problematic because the mounting plate system look pretty flimsythe mounting method to be used for this fan is to first install screw in the wall stud or with drywall anchor at the exact location of the mounting slot then slip the fan and foot with mounting plate which are embedded in the foot of the fan over the screw head if youve done this you know it requires accurate placement of the screw and then adjustment of the screw depth to create a tight fit not terribly difficult but not forgiving of error either a hole in the drywall in the wrong place and youve created a repair job access hole through the fan plastic foot to the anchor plate would make the job easy but there are nonethe first abandoned plan to make it work in case you are thinking about thisplan to reverse the mounting plate mount it at a degree angle for decent airflow directional control and turn the fan upsidedown so the control are the fan housing and can be seen and reached this would also point the fan in the correct direction cant this safety shut off fan doesnt runthe second abandoned plan to make it work plan place the fan on a high shelf at the end of the my work area table top mode and direct airflow downward cant do this the fan will not allow downward air flow adjustment remember the physical stopso whythis leaf me with five question about design problem why isnt the pivot set at degree to the base or parallel to the base why arent the control on the base of the unit instead of on the side which put them ontop when mounted why isnt there access through the plastic foot for mounting the unit to the wall why prohibit reversing the mounting orientation with the automatic shutoff and why design it so it will not point down at all in tabletop modeif those problem corrected the fan could still be attractive and it would become easily mountable useful and actually function a advertised which in my opinion it doe notend resulti bought it and i will use it but not mounted on the wall i bought it for i will use it a a tabletop fan periodi would not buy another recommend this fan to anyone except a a tabletop fan and even then with reservation with one exception if you have the correct wall to accept the fan required orientation a low mounting height so you can reach the control adequate carpentry skill and a space that work with the degree airflow pivot this fan would be finei gave it star because it is a fan and it doe run i generous,2,2,2,1,2014,2,21,1,2014-02-21

1182,A3H9011CL38F67,B0012LG2GM,pitcher two year time review the previous review initial review gave product five star adjusted it downward to three the main reason is the price the filter increase tremendously the initial purchase becoming aware of the unhealthy chemical drinking water i also have become aware filtering using pitcher is expensive effective a i would like becoming aware that the added chemical make the water acidic filtering becomes mandatory for drinking water even for the pet finding that one of the best way to assist in keeping everyone healthier is to filter i find that the filter last week and never make it for a full month i leaning toward a more permanent inline system and getting away from the annoying pitcher the annoying hose attached to the faucet system taking valuable counter top space that the annoying pitcher system is better the unhealthy nosystem is obviousthe following paragraph is the previous review posted two year ago to fair and to show the thinking changed with time i am leaving it up i mention that the filter seem to last a long time i have come to realize that someone to remove the filter and put it back in the indicator start it seems to be measuring the quantity of water rather than the current quality of the filterpreviously i had a different filtration and thought that the water tasted strange i rarely used it after buying a clearo pitcher i impressed with the improved taste of the water the filter seem to last much longer than the brand the saving from not buying bottled water is of questionable quality more than offset the initial cost and the cost of replacement filtersi have had the initial filter in the pitcher for about fifty gallon of water and wa thinking that it wa near time to replace it is a small window which always wa green it finally changed to yellow which is indicator that it is near time to change the filter seem to last a long time the cost of the filter reasonable for the amount of water it clean more than the previous pitcherone thing that i would recommend is the extension hose inch for only about six dollar,3,2,0,0,2011,4,7,2,2011-04-07

1337,A37DXIENIDHTVY,B00COVHOIO,wasnt market countertop grill i doubt id sprung for one hadnt come the vine list for free review ive the route cheapy grill and generally speaking worth the money if are going to buy one it worth spending to get past the low quality small size of inexpensive grill i bet dad spent two hundred buck going cheap grill two year time just didnt cook well or small to adequately prepare a main dish item for two or more peoplei havent a steak i willing to risk cooking this grill yet but ive cooked plenty of chicken and fish with it and it a great job the nonstick really is nonstick for the meat i have had bakedon meat debris that not just wipe clean but i put a couple of wet paper towel over the cooled grill plate and it wiped right or minute i tried the grill side with the chicken and i didnt care for the result too much it took a lot longer to cook compared to the griddle side and i like the more even browning that the griddle side gave the chicken the fish cooked perfectly on the griddle i see using the grill side for hotdog and sausage type meat though i have cooked some smoked sausage on the griddle side and it work fine i reckon you could carefully flip the hot grill to use the opposite side for two different meat but i didnt bother with itthis grill a temperature indicator light and a temperature dial are two feature to have in grill the grill plate is heavy and sturdy i store mine on top of the fridge and i wasnt careful i put it up one time and the entire thing three piece came crashing to floor have linoleum over cheap wood floor the floor wa not damaged which i figure wa dumb luck and the grill wa undamaged which i figure is mighty sturdy considering the six foot dropi personally not like dishwashing machine id use one if i had a lot of dish stacking up every day but that isnt the case i dont even one washing it in the sink is kind of a pain of size and the modest size of the sink in the kitchen mostly i just give it a wipe down and trust the blazing heat to sanitize it on the next go roundit is a big grill thats good because you can prepare more food like a couple of good sized steak one time but you need some real estate available in the kitchen so if you have limited counter space you need to take some measurement to make sure youll able to use it you get iti mentioned my dad going through several inexpensive grill one of the one used wa i think the best of the bunch it wa very similar to this onelivart orange bbq grill electric barbecue grill a thick steak be a serious challenge with a grill like this but le expensive make it a worthwhile alternative and it will fit a smaller space better and cooking thinly cut meat on a grill like this is awesometheres a lot of love about the oster grill i enjoy owning and using it i agree that it take a to heat up but the cooking area seems to be very evenly heated when it reach temperature i might try a foil tent next time i cook smoked sausage on it to cook it with le turning,5,2,1,1,2013,8,19,2,2013-08-19

1530,A1O5NDRKV5N64P,B001RRG5VI,looking foam soap dispenser i idea worked they required i decided one based on positive review i had thought foaming dispenser required a special liquid soap this one doesntjust fill line the way up regular liquid hand soap top it with water it that easy this design really cut on soap usage and therefore save money especially since many regular home soap dispenser create waste putting slippery soap that slide off hand or ooze out the nozzlewhen i filled the dispenser for the first time i wa actually pretty disappointed when i used it for the first time it put out a thick viscous semifoam resembling a hybrid of regular soap and foamnot what i wa expected the next day however it magically transformed light fluffy foam i suppose the hand soap need to fully dissolve into the water it work optimally so youre a new buyer and think you dont like the foam it make try waiting a day and see if it improves i didnt see anything about this the documentation and it certainly surprised and yes it like this every time you fill it the first timethe only downside mentioned that you dont get optimal result immediately for me it take a full day to get perfect foam i dont know if this is just how it work or if perhaps this is just of water quality or brand of liquid soap in case the benefit definitely outweigh that downside youll use le soap save money and the feel of foam soap regular thick hand soap is a improvementupdate i got sick of the poor performance this give on the day it refilled see above so i decided to experiment i found that if you fill the dispenser with hot water add soap and give it a stir it instantly work perfectly either hot water or stirring greatly improves performance but is even better i didnt see this mentioned in the instruction so if youre frustrated give it a try,5,2,9,9,2010,11,1,1,2010-11-01

2005,A25JMBP75O8J3U,B002I0K5W8,deal game came attention surprise the title kinda my opinion the radar in term marketing and publicity least at firstnow the fact this game is already sold first day amazon speaks volume to much word of mouth taken this game so youve played the demo is exceptional and still unsure whether to purchase the game perhaps lend hand and help make a informed decisionmultiplayer okay normally i dont start this topic however this seems to the one that people the concern therefore i feel i must address this first are basically two different type of multiplayer mode essentially the first type is you play in explore mode technically this is a single player type mode however ill give the multiplayer seal of approval basically in this mode if you have a friend that ha played a certain course it let you compete with a ghost of kinda like how back in for example mario kart for of you that have played it or about racing game like gran turismo for that matter in which you would a time trial and try and race a ghost of to beat time well in this case youre competing against the saved ghost of a friend whether by beating time or a certain amount of point the type of multiplayer mode is basically the thing except rather limited to just your friend timesscores you are competing in global event against the vast majority of those ownrent ssx provided have online pas if youre wondering if this game ha athome splitscreen multiplayer capabilitiesi regret to inform you that it not so if that is a deal breaker toward purchasing this game i would recommend searching elsewheregameplay in short for it is top notch getting more detailed however there are game mode to endure i already mentioned the global event and explore mode yet also there is somewhat of a story mode called world tour mode this is you can unlock of the character although you can also unlock them by purchasing them with ingame credit and also learn the basic of the game and the different type of gear that can be used to enhancehelp you course basically there are region and also a a p exclusive a japan mt fuji level is included in explore mode to explore each with several course that you can play through course are split three category race trick and survival the first two are pretty much selfexplanatory and a for survival that basically put your boarder against various extreme condition and youre given a certain type of gear to help aid you through the challenge whether it be an oxygen tank to help you survive thin air at mt everest or an ice axe to help you board more smoothly on overly icy surface each character n the game level up and a they do so you can purchase new gear to improve their performance i havent seen it all yet so far there seems to be a decent amount of customization anyway said all that there is a lot of replay value in all of this especially if youre into collecting trophy and it actually kinda cool to try and outscore or beat your friend recordsa satisfying feeling if i may say so myselfgraphics very well done theyre not phenomenal however you can clearly tell that both time and effort wa put into trying to make this snowboarding experience a feast for the eye all the location and various weather condition are accurately portrayed here in this game so if youre the type of gamer where look are important then i can safely say you will not be disappointed heresound overall the sound here is not bad the soundtrack itself used the game is actually fairly enjoyable however the voice acting is mildly cheesyalso the thing that the character say is kinda cheesy a wellyet this game isnt suppose to be serious it a sport fantasy that let player enact their wildest dream at the touch of a button so with that in mind ill let the cheesy factor slide since it is all in good funcontrols personally i find them fairly easy to get use to for those of you that may be veteran of the series the game allows you to switch toandfrom an ssx classic control setting which is actually pretty neat yet aside that i havent really any trouble with either bad camera angle or control what so ever which is a definite plusalright with that out of the way here are what my score for the game itself would begraphics control sound multiplayer gameplay overall to be honest it hard for me to give the game a score of a cause in my opinion that seems a little low it really is a great title and it is a rather enjoyable arcadestyle action experience but then i have to force to realize that it isnt exactly perfectthe multiplayer is great but could have better especially with the use of athome splitscreen either way these are just my thought and personal opinion on the game hopefully with this review you can pick up a copy and see for yourself bottom line id definitely say to at least give this game a rent but i would definitely say it warrant a purchase if youre into these sort of game update march alright ive had quite a bit of playtime with this game since receiving it on it release date and i must say this game truly is incredible i didnt think id end up clocking in a much time with this game a i already have but life is full of surprise it would be a crime for me to not strongly recommend this game there is nothing quite like that rush or feeling you get when you take a friend score or beat their time in an event and youd be yourself a disservice if you choose not to at least pick this up a a rental again i know im slightly being redundant here but the purpose of this update is to show that my stance on the game hasnt declined in fact it may have grown even betterupdate march ive earned of the trophy now for the game there are trophy in all for those wondering so ive put in a decent amount of time playing this im going to change my score for the sound category from to well a another reviewer mentioned you can edit the music that play ingame with a playlistsongs of your own provided that youve uploaded them onto your p nothing quite like racing to the sound of paradise city or party rock anthem this is a really neat feature that i believe more game implement in the future anyway if you have any question feel free to ask,5,3,12,9,2012,2,28,1,2012-02-28

2013,APWCOAVILK94B,B001OAKV4K,game much fun always wanted play real life fps like this would least make me feel like firing real gun for real effect is a sniper mission cod mw in which to sneak within enemy line take a terrorist leader i immensely enjoyed mission due to dread gave me discovered even though i playing ai bot also the one shot kill sniper gun is i like to play like precise minimum shot and mostly stealth i have waiting for experience for long till i got hand ofpdgalmost of ofps mission like this sense of dread of being killed instantly anybody else with a gun is perfect even though the ai bot are dumb sure know to fire in direction and at least out of bullet they fire land on you you end with a minor flesh wound to incapacitated to dead with a critical shot so playing against ai is very challenging and you have to kill soon a they spot you you can hide they come around your position ready to fire at you cqb with ai is a very unstable situation which you wont walk out alive of the timethe best way to get kill is to spot and snipe enemy with marksman rifle from up to away and use sniper rifle above that range i single shot firing a anything else destroys the accuracy and waste bullet for firing m bullet path adjusting need to done that range you will hit you aim if you counter the recoil i always find killing ai team mate to steal marksman and sniper rifle if they happen to have it the night ops mod gun are the best night mission a you can search the landscape for enemy that appear whitenow this initial buzz i would like to get the real trouble bugging this game the friendly ai is dumb and irritating at time if you ask them to move to a position they will move metre away from it and keep walking towards the enemy in a mission that requires you to rescue downed pilot a soon a you discover the ai pilot they assume command of your team something instead of following your order i say follow me they will say the thing and go in the direction of the chasing and gunning enemy only to get killed and fail the mission the only way to solve this wa to take out all enemy discovering the hostage and leading them to safety when i mounted on a vehicle if i order the ai to move from point a to b they tend to take the straight line path and get stuck at obstacle the enemy ai is predictable and always chicken out and fall prone to the ground if you fire near their headsshoulders and in all the fuss to get back up they are sitting duck to my fire i encounter some instance in which the enemy fired from insidebehind a wall there is way they could see me coming there are a shtload of problem with the buggy multiplayer you can see soldier dead and stuck in the sky if you kill them during a helicopter ride you can shoot an enemy time with a sniper rifle at m and still wont die but you can kill with a vehicle mounted gun often get disconnected from host if host leaf game end they have learned from cod got kicked due to some unknown reason a time wa it the host player or wa it because i shot at friendly ai player mostly lagging player cause frictional jerky movement especially in vehiclessome of the way to make this game better will be fixing the multiplayer issue also add a way to choose weapon in single and multi player a it add a lot of replayability in addition mapsmissions should be added a dlc for single and multi player the single player wa extremely short and there wa no big war anywhere a every mission amounted to only a short skirmish,3,3,6,5,2009,11,6,1,2009-11-06

2051,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000P46NMA,several year le neglecting assassin creed best described good reason whatsover finally decided go ahead jump series after hearing much wonder a to i never really jumped into it the long run im a bit disappointed i waited the way the third release to start i suppose better late never the hand for a much fun a assassin creed im sure strong the first entry is a story standpoint it a damn amazing game great twist and turn and a great plot likewise from a production stand point it also pretty awesome is why it so sad the spot assassin creed hit a snag is of all thing the gameplayby of probably familiar with the story but it never hurt to a refresher of sort desmond is kidnapped abstergo he subject and is hooked to a machine called the animus allows to experience the memory of a man named altair this wa a man wa part of the assassin in the third crusade after failing a mission altair is stripped of rank and his weapon taken away the way for him to work his way back up is to go and assassinate nine templar to prove a the plot move on it becomes a pretty engrossing tale in particular so much of it is so well presented the plot can be a little thick time and take some time to get to the point but it overall strong it also a plus that the voice acting is also incredibly strong tooreally drawing you into this fictional worldunfortunately this is part of where assassin creed can also hit a snag the world may be a bit big at time not so much the incredibly populated locale but rather that so many of the mission are repetitive you generally go on smaller mission to find people and interrogate or something before moving on to mark there not much variety at all the city are fun to explore the mission make the world seem smaller than it actually is there a lot to explore and some collecting to but for the most part this is no grand theft auto there a much deeper story but dont expect to be able to explore a city wrecking havoc wherever you go for some time assassin creed take pretty seriously in some respect and this is something to love the city are detailed with you also able to look across the landscape to map the data for on the other hand it quite surprising how little it feel like you can do after a while particularly because of the way you have to go about it often time youll have to blend in run around and push people about too much and youll alert enemy to your presence and have to fight them off and this is perhaps where assassin creed stumble the most the combat is for the most part boringdont get wrong the combat can be fun but after a while it becomes even more repetitive than the mission themselves this is because combat is relatively easy the guard often time stand by and let you take them on one by one and most time all it take is just a simple counter and theyll go easy and youll go this again and again and again the challenge is merely nonexistent this rear it head even more so you take into account that most of the bad guy are surprisingly stupid a altair you can blend in with crowd sometimes this work a little too well a altair may a well just be invisible you can sneak up behind a guard kill him and watch him drop to the ground while another guard look on so long a you blend theyll never suspect it you at first it hilarious to see a guard watch you stab someone and say five second later who this after a while however the novelty of a thing wear off and this is something that can also be exploited all the time when youre spotted and run away there are time when thing will be a little tough but stand and fight and youll easily emerge victorious on the other hand running and hiding work just a well sometimes so long a you get far enough away you can hide in bail of hay and the guard wont detect you on the other hand when you run far enough away and just sit on a bench and cant find you it can break your immersionassassins creed is still fun it just that it easy to take advantage of one of the best thing about it however is how one can seamlessly run across rooftop scale wall and jump from one protruding ledge to another it pretty seamless and isnt complicated at all not to mention you do manage to screw up it not big deal it also not sluggish at all or nearly a meticulous a say uncharted there room for error here and there are often many different place to explore guard will often attempt to follow you or hurl rock at you to knock you down and some will try to follow but theyll still rarely be a match for youthe game is a wonder on the eye by far a one of the better looking game in it wa a looker for sure particularly the location there definitely a pulse in the city area are populated with people going about business and their day you really get the sense that the denizen have life youll even hear them speaking a time or mumbling to themselves and the way altair interacts with them is quite fascinating a well a you run for instance hell push people of the way if youre walking hell gently brush past them the animation are smooth much of the time even when scaling wall there a lot of meticulous detail here it just a shame that from time to time the game buckle it weight there will be time when the frame rate will dip and there will be some performance issue there also moment of clipping although in experience they were few and far betweenwhat save assassin creed from many of it fault is that the narrative and story is very good despite how repetitive it can be youll often find yourself wanting to go down the rabbit hole to unravel more of the plot because that actually is pretty interesting in and of itself,4,3,1,1,2012,12,21,1,2012-12-21

2082,AU02STWO7S5E8,B005DVAB1Y,first im huge ninja gaiden fan since itagaki team ninja resurrected series modern gaming ninja gaiden and ninja gaiden ninja gaiden black along sigma and sigma im also someone a huge enthusiast for gaming subgenrea i have devil may cry bayonetta castlevania lord shadow god of war ninja blade dante inferno and a host of others ive experience of the best the way the mediocre im not a guru mean but still enthusiast the thing is itagaki and the real team ninja arent anymore and all the lead left of fiasco tecmo love itagaki hate he really know to make game awesome but im not to discus opinion difference on the development teamsi must say that im disappointed with this entry the series ive always regarded the original ninja gaiden and ninja gaiden the gold standard for this type of game im quickly getting the minor detail out of the way technically im not super impressed not the reason im really disgusted with this entry the graphic and sound fine not amazing but not really bad to the point that it hard to look at another part of the presentation is the story doesnt really impress either but old or new team ninja story never strong point wa there to give the game structure but not a majory selling pointmy primary gripe honestly resolved around the change in the gameplay which is made the first entry in the series great people always complained the camera but it wa a minor problem at the what get me though is the horrible level design the previous game have large area there are some thing to wall run along and stunt while also plenty of room to deal out death this new game it seems to like to put the player in a small to medium sized pen where guy come behind obstacle like crashed car it feel youre ready to move on there flow of combat with the area no long hallway or large ballroom or temple courtyard to flip or wallrun it just a one level small pen which not much room to maneuver to be able to do movesthe gameplay also feel sluggish and unresponsive i found too many time that i wa trying to turn ryu or get him to flip out of a group of enemy or use specific combination but it seems to not respond properly there time that i wanted him to fight a specific target and he wanted to look at someone else which would lead me to actually get hit even i could gaet him to do what i want it wa slow and just didnt seem responsive but that doeasnt matter because honestly this game is super easy even when it not the hero mode the new developer talked about much in the previous game button mashed you learned that hardway and died this game you just get a gentle smack there no reward or satisfaction to something difficult because it handed to you the flow of combat seems off too in the st ninja gaiden it wa focused on a target with a small of other other guy to go you almost this nice way of focusing on a target yet untangle group or go after friend ninja gaiden really improved it too where there wa a fluid motion of engaging an enemy and finishing him then moving onto the next enemy withing a large group of enemy it felt almost a though you could chain the fight one large string of combo if you timed it well enough here it seems messy fight are somewhat chaotic but not in a good way it wa a though the rd game took battle element of the previous two game but made a mess of it nothing seemed to work right along with the sluggish control engagement just dont seem to have good pacing to do combo or to switch target the handling and gameplay element just seem off to me compared to other game in thie genre and even in this seriesnow quick time event or qte i always hated these in god of war i feel that are a lazy way for developer to do the top sequence without really making it part of the gameplay i do find done some way where it tasteful but for action game i feel they are detracting that fun game like bayonetta and the new castlevania overall kept these to a minimum which is what i like i just dont find it fun doing a ddr rhythm game when i be setting combo to a group of enemy theyre more there to distract the casual add gamer more anything i thinka couple of other thing i want to go through would be the lame gameplay gimmick like the kunai climbing which is not only boring but doesnt seem to really have done well at all but maybe they wanted to distract u from the monotony another is the lack of decapitation personally it not just gore for gore sake but more along the line of gore that look awesome because of the very nature of what ninja combat is it an great viseral aestetic of the nature of the gamei could go on about other thing but i think the bulk of what a longtime hardcore ninja gaiden fan like needed to say wa said and frankly i dont want to write a whole essay on this there are others who elaborate about why feel this game wa a bit insulting to the fan of the series we lament the disappointment that this latest entry is and in some way i want to dream that itagaki and the real team ninja would come back to save this beloved franchise one day,1,3,45,38,2012,3,21,1,2012-03-21

2085,A27OW0P38B28OP,B000084318,wind waker interesting game say the least development never another zelda game garnered polarized reaction anticipating fan regard to reaction to wws artistic style gamers got their hand gem however fear zelda going astray becoming childish quickly dispelled and were treated to one special game know one could argue the legend of zelda ocarina of time is the greatest zelda game of all time you could also argue that twilight princess is the best refined zelda game of all time actually agree with of statement despite that though wind waker is still personal favorite zelda game and one that i absolutely incredible amount of nostalgia truly is a special gamethe most noticeable and immediately striking aspect of wind waker is undoubtedly graphic despite initial cynicism most people came to embrace this aspect of the game and view it one of it strongest aspect the cel shaded graphic on display spectacularly vibrant and seem to really pop the screen a you were actually looking a window a space another great benefit of this graphical style is that it really lends to emotional impactful storytelling in fact i find that wind waker character convey emotion and thought better of game released despite many are using advanced technology like motion capture these day this really add to the impact and emotional strength of wind waker already moving epic storythe art design really compliment this cel shaded graphical style well the place you go the people you encounter all of it scream classic nostalgic zelda taking you to place of well exactly hyrule sort of that you wont expect from going into flaming volcano to inside an island held entirely in a magical vast hallowedout tree trunk this is one heck of a visual adventure sailing across a vast ocean never looked good the music not go unmentioned either you hear classic legend of zelda theme and motif in the music but also new music that really fit in with that classical zelda vibe while striking a decidedly colorful tone on it the sound design is of equal caliber a well and really add to the atmosphere of every environment you visitseeing how this is a zelda game you can pretty much guess the premise of the story it set in a world the ocean cover most of the landscape pockmarked island big and small on one particular island it is customary for boy of a certain age to dress a the legendary hero of time from the nowfairytale folklore people tellthe story that gamers played in ocarina of time in order to instill and emulate in the boy the same courage a that legendary hero of time well it one boy birthday but wearing the hero tunic is more than customary a is to become his own fabled hero his sister is kidnapped by a giant evil bird and he go to save herthats the initial premise of the story it not entirely derivative of the princess in distress tale were used to and by the end of this epic tale link will have joined pirate become the next hero approved by the god go through dungeon for ancient powerful artifact to save the day meet familiar character and have one heckuva climatic ending sequence to think thats a taste of where the story will take you i have to admit when i first went into ww i expected amazing gameplay gorgeous sound and art design and a merely decent acceptable story but boy i in for a surprise the story here is exceptionally deep even surprisingly dark time and that is right my alley i absolutely love the story in wind waker and it may very well my favorite aspect it definitely isnt kiddy in sense of the word it a adult a any of link adventure have ever i really dont want to give away any specific detail but suffice to say i picked my jaw off the floor and even held back a tear here and more than once throughout the entire tale it truly specialthe gameplay is a you would expect from a zelda game meaning refined near perfection the basic format is here explore a large open world find important area and meet important people go on sidequests enter crucial temple go through dungeon with it various clever puzzle and new gadget imperative to succeed and fight epic bos battle the thing different here is that instead of traversing dry land on epona you traverse vast oceanic space on the red king of lion the overworld is an ocean this really feel like the biggest zelda game space ever even in retrospectsome find the sailing part to be boring but not i find very relaxing and enjoyable to take in the game world radiant sunrise beautiful sunset and storm on the open sea is a sight to behold and it scene like this the sailing sequence that really add to the atmotsphere of the story there are le temple in wind waker than zelda game and is a bit shorter a a result it also seems to be a bit easier than other title in this franchise but none of these issue lessen the value of the experience in any way this is a good a zelda gameplay get in fact there is a substantial amount of swordplay improvement here it predecessor and that really add to the feeling of a legendary swordsman hero amazing stuffi know that im missing of the more minor detail here but im sure you get the idea i could write twice this much time three about this amazing gemstone in nintedos gaming library a a matter of fact i have played this game at least once year since i bought it and it never get old show any sign of age whatsoever it a timeless classic and a mustplay for anyone love zelda adventure with fantastic story this game feel like a prettier more stylistic ocarina of time it an incredibly epic story a beautiful imaginationfueled design and gameplay bordering on perfection it really is that good buy it sail through it majesty and become a new hero worthy of legend,5,3,3,3,2011,9,6,2,2011-09-06

2098,A1UH8M9QALD2LS,B001G9F9KA,storyyou begin game atsuki saijo young member the group named fort the person charge of rooting infection called silent he traveled the town of kisaragi in order to track the perpetrator of several crime a well a a notorious silent infectee investigating atsuki to pose a a normal high school student and glean information peer the story while sounding simple enough first becomes confusing and difficult to wade a time go doesnt help the game come multiple ending meaning want the full picture youre going to to play through it multiple time the plot isnt would call bad it certainly try to mash many theme together the tone of the story seemed to a horror storymystery at the start but it quickly changed to one of high school fluff and drama the mixture didnt sit well with especially since you could find looking at a suicide one minute and discussing cake the nextgameplayas known a a visual novel the gameplay in luxpain mainly consists of sifting through mountain of text while running around town talking to different people the game try to give you the illusion that youre free to go you want school but thats really it an illusion always certain place where you wont be able to go and really there almost strategy involved in searching the town all you have to is check the available area hitting the hay at atsukis house luxpain really hold hand throughout the entire course of the game and rarely let you have control of your action it certainly possible to choose order you want to do thing in but it almost never make a difference at school and around town youll often find people to talk to and theyll rattle string of dialogue while you stand around saying nothing there are a time and there youll get to navigate a bland and uninteresting dialogue tree but that atsuki is completely quiet it nice that there many people around town to talk to but i often got the feeling that were talking at me with me a little more freedom of choice would have helped the game a whole lot you never really choose anything to say do in fact the mystery basically solves youoccasionally when talking with people atsuki notice a worm inside someone and begin using sigma to detect it it a bit like a simple minigame all you have to do is scratch away at the screen and then hold the stylus the worm it gone there really not much skill involved with it thats done a term will appear the term is generally just a few word which will appear to have almost no meaning at first sometimes the term are relevant to the mystery but sometimes theyre completely inane at the start of the game i impressed with the way the thought of the killer and his victim presented there wa a sense of disjointedness and all tension and fear but the majority of other people thought are a good deal le impressive i remember that near the start of the game i to scan rui yamase and tap on a worm the term showed and thought were abouthow much liked her school it wa quite simply useless information ruis love of school wa never vital information and it didnt provide me with real insight anything either that wasnt the time it happened there were several other occasion where the thought of the person had nothing to do with the investigation at all sometimes phrase are mentioned and then never brought up every and again youll encounter a larger silent inside of someone and then you have to go through luxpains equivalent of a bos battle sequence are rarely anything more challenging than simply tapping on the touch screen though there almost no other interactivity with the touch screen except for the moment when you have to scribble madly at the screen in order to uncover a worm of the time due to the enormous amount of text youll simply be mashing the a button like your life depends on itone of the many thing that rubbed me the wrong way luxpain wa the fact that i constantly had to refer back to the manual to remind what wa going on at the beginning of the story the game simply dump you into the overworld map without so much a a vague explanation of the menu system lack of a tutorial can actually severely affect gameplay case in point certain event are limitedtimeonly and expire if you dont see to right away natsuki one of atsukis ally from fort ha a very useful scanning ability which let you know much time you have to witness the event before it lost forever unfortunately the game neglect to inform you of this in fact i didnt even realize that event had time limit until i missed one or two of them missing important cutscenes mean that you will most likely not get the best ending on your first playthrough there an incredible amount of information that the game simply doesnt tell you instead youll have to pick up your manual assuming you still own it and read through it just to figure out what in the blue blaze youre supposed to be doingthats the majority of luxpains gameplay in a nutshell visit place at school and around town talk to people listen to inane psychobabble repeat it not bad it just boring half the time youll have no idea what your peer or fellow townsfolk are talking or thinking about and trying to shovel through massive clot of pointless dialogue only make the problem worsevisuals character audio and writingluxpain is a visual novel and a usually consists of simple static image on an unmoving background character sprite usually have a few different emotion all of which look decent and get the point across it a slicklooking game and will most likely appeal to an audience enjoys anime and manga it closely resembles of the more recent persona game in case a frame of reference is needed there are quite a few different character and animation packed into the game which is something ill praise luxpain for the music wa decent but nothing struck me a particularly memorable it wa standard fare and served mainly a background noise to whatever else wa going onas mentioned before there are ton of character in luxpain really there are youll encounter a variety of people from day to day some of which may end up being key part of your investigation the game manages to flesh out most of your schoolmate fairly well but there one glaringly obvious problem that rubbed me the wrong way i didnt connect at all with atsuki let sum thing upatsuki an orphan whose parent and sister were killed he supposedly quite attractive but brood a lot and rarely say anything throughout the course of the game he show little emotion or reaction to anything his friend do or say how many of these hero have i seen before his type is a dimeadozen it not a though i like or disliked it a though he just never bothered to show up on the day when they were handing out personalitiesmy final and possibly most infuriating problem with luxpain is the translation and localization issue to put it frankly the game is absolutely filled with grammar punctuation and spelling error this is a textbased game in which virtually all you do is read they have no excuse for screwing it up sometimes i found myself getting lost in the midst of conversation the way the character talked wa so obtuse and irregular the dialogue is no mean unintelligible but it very distracting to try and pay attention to a serious scene when eye keep getting stuck on missing punctuation mark sometimes usually more important scene a voiceover will begin the voice acting is quite good i have no complaint with it so whats the matter the text and the voice sometimes dont match it confusing frustrating and above all it make you wonder who proofread this game it really have cleaned up more before being released to the consumer if you are a stickler for proper grammar and spelling bewareconclusionluxpain could have been a great game the concept of exploring a town hunting down a supernatural mental virus and uncovering a sinister plot sound awesome unfortunately it didnt live up to my expectation the lack of tutorial repetitive nature of gameplay convoluted story and flawed dialogue will drive many gamers into either a state of severe boredom or a one of teethgnashing insanity although i had a decent time with it i cant really recommend itthe whole thing left a rather bad taste in my mouth because it could have been great only it wasnt,3,3,17,16,2009,10,22,2,2009-10-22

2149,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B00ENFVUGQ,hesitated play xcom enemy unknown im huge fan alpha centauri alien crossfire expansion i havent liked a civilization game since civ ii and the game based the original xcom wa complex to get nevertheless one day i decided to give it a try told great it wa a coworker and try it i didxcomenemy unknown wa for me equal part amazement and frustration everyone played it know a hard game a hard game hard fact that i completely lost the game on first playthrough on easy my pride wa severely wounded to say nothing of my squad member i decided to try it and on the second playthrough i wa able to beat the game i found the gameplay to amazingly fun but hard hard hard oh yeah and xcomenemy unknown in the window pc version ha horrible bug im talking gamebreaking bug a in spending hour playing to it suddenly freeze the entire pc a in running window update and finding that the game wont launch a in freezing for second at a time every minute and locking my pc completely on the final level i wa eventually able to beat the game by saving often in the middle of battle rebooting frequently and uninstalling hundred of patch on my computer and removing every program except the bare essential needed to boot and use my pc but good grief the game good butit left me wishing i gotten the console versionfast forward to the end of year my best bro bought me a copy of this expansion a great guy after played the game to completion i have concluded that anyone interested skip enemy unknown entirely for first playthrough and then go back to the original want to try a steamlined experience my reasonsbug fixespraise the lord of gaming the horrible gamebreaking bug that plagued enemy unknown have fixed in this expansion the freezing in battle is gone the game launch failure gone the complete system lockup are gone and yes i wa even able to complete the final mission in a single sitting without my computer crashing woohoo i havent tried playing the original enemy unknown since getting enemy within yet so i cant say whether the fix affect i may never know becauserebalanced gameplayyeah yeah people have gone on and on about how the original enemy unknown wa balanced like a fine violin playing while sipped fine wine and ate your fine cheese your fine girlfriend but i to burst your bubble and tell you that enemy unknown had aspect that really unbalanced for starter assault class soldier were almost impossible to keep alive they mucho damage but since they have fewer hitpoints and are best at close range i watched all of get massacred likewise heavy had poor aim that they were pretty much useless so like people i just ended up making a squad of mostly sniper and medic this my friend is balance enemy within fix thisquite simply the addition of meld force you to come of hiding and go after objective making the offensivedefensive more balanced and use additional capability to balance the deficiency in your soldiersinvisible psychic mutantsenemy unknown had special type of armor but their perk were so low compared to their negative that you wouldnt be blamed for just sticking with plainjane weapon and armor that simply did the most damage all that change with meld though now your assault class literally be the most powerful unit in the game i know this because my bluehaired german woman had genetic cloaking autofire on near enemy double attack and so many defensive stat boost that yes wa pretty much impossible to kill ah nothing like a double shotgun to the servo of a mech by a woman who fire a cannon at point blank range and wa two foot away because she wa invisible and of course if that doesnt work shell fry youwith mind mwahaahaaa ahem at rate when you have medic that cant be poisoned strangled heavy with super vision and invisible assault troop that special armor and weapon youve been throwing away and all the lovely new addition to this game go being useless to useful tradeoff giving cloaking armor to your medic who cant be poisoned or flight gear to your supereagleeyed sniper suddenly make a lot more sense this would unbalance the game if it werent for all the new soupedup enemy tromping around in mech suit and strangling you like smaller version of squidies from the matrix but thats okay becausesuper robot warsthe mech suit completely change thing up in this expansion because they can not hide they are good for charging into battle because they can heal multiple unit they encourage you to be more wreckless in your charge and because they can devestating closerange damage to a single unit or cause panicdeath in entire group they arejust plain fun seriously who doesnt want to run around in a giant robot suit smashing and blasting alien isnt that every boy dreamthe more thing changethere are more map to play on more mission an entire subplot with an enemy organization a frantic battle to defend the base an alien attack more type of grenade more language spoken medal to pin on your best troop genetic modification robot suit of armor but the main game and the primary gameplay have not changed if you didnt like enemy unknown this game wont convert you arent underwater mission or sky mission or space mission youre not going to fly skyrangers or have any new type of gameplay but the addition here are enough that this is definitely version of xcom and there is very little reason to go back in my opinion i can do without most of the other change people might have asked for but one just irritate me a bit i would love a branch storyline with different ending or at the very least a better one got in enemy unknown that said the journey is still very much worth taking and this game is even more fun that it wa couple that with the miraculous bug fix and we have a winner for everyone who enjoyed the first game and a great entry point for everyone who hasnt given it a try yet,5,3,2,1,2014,1,23,1,2014-01-23

2173,A3AQJOBOI60CVJ,B002BSC4ZS,metroid hard game review a lot reason first take a beloved franchise remove many of element made it great it also feature a previously mute character become a poorlywritten horriblyacted wuss the face of the danger shes faced in many way a step back for the metroid franchise the excellent prime gamesi guess since everyone else need to talk the story first metroid other m story is abomination it script is one of the worst ever written it contains moment that make sense in of the game context it twist obvious and handled poorly point made hour ago are repeated endlessly a murder mystery plot is brought and left completely unresolved many pointed out the fact that samus aran previously an amazingly competent female bounty hunter is reduced to a simpering mother figure must subservient to a man who doesnt outrank there something to that and yeah it amazingly sexist even apart clunkily it handled im concerned about it doe to the feel of the gameprevious metroid game based exploration contained labyrinthine world and the gameplay based around the gradual widening of world new weapon and tool became available they became series of revelation that built upon one another culminating in bos battle and discovery feeling of accomplishment is replaced the arbitrary edict of a bureaucrat that samus doesnt even work for and the implementation stink for reason this guy cant be bothered to authorize the varia suit the second samus step an environment that hurt her no need to wait awhile this independent woman suffers for no reason all beyond that an explanation is given to certain type of weapon cant be used make a certain amount of sense but what possible reason could be to authorize the use of a suit that doe nothing but protect it wearer what about the grapple beam which isnt a weapon at all or the speed booster this is never really explained there no way it could be made to make sensethe gameplay of other m is better it story though still containing many odd decision one of the strangest is the ability to scan some object but not others the game constantly contains thing that look like they be useful but arent this is a departure from the prime series in which nearly everything could be scanned for useful information and worldbuilding thats all gone here in favor of able to scan object that be blown up and occasionally storyrelevant object the game also contains annoying section in which it shift to firstperson scan the correct thing which isnt labeled more than once i to spin around until something looked interestingthe core gameplay is similar to a version of super metroid with le exploration this is far the linear metroid game and i think thats a mistake in a series known for it explorationbased gameplay the decision to use the wiis dpad instead of the nunchuks analog stick lead to some imprecision though one get the impression that the game wa designed with this in mind problem with it rarely come up in addition the decision to wrest the decision of to use missile away from the player lead to some very frustrating moment the elimination of powerups is an odd omission a well instead of getting simply hold the wiimote upwards and hold a until missile refill or when youre low on health until a bar fill restoring some of it one could argue this wa done to avoid the problem of collecting powerups in a pseudo d environment but the original prime solved this problem in by letting the charge beam attract the power ups i dont understand why this couldnt have done here toobut and this is a big but one cant really blame nintendo or team ninja for refusing to simply make another entry in the prime series a someone who preferred the control scheme of the gamecube controller to that of metroid prime imprecise aiming mechanism i can see why someone would want to move away from it while the game on the whole may be a mistake it at least took some chance with the formula of metroid in an attempt to streamline it instead of adding feature nintendo been playing it safe for so long with some many of it franchise it kind of nice to see them take a chance with a major label the chance doesnt pay a well a it should have but hey this is how progress get madethe compliment i can give other m are actually kind of numerous despite the control problem the team made them work pretty well for the bos battle which are often pretty spectacular the fight with ridley despite immediately following one of the game most insulting moment is one of the best encounter with in of the game comparable i think to the encounter at the end of the first prime the game functional final boss are great a well a little short the game difficulty curve is about deadon for i think the final bos may actually be the most difficult to killthe game benefit from extremely brisk pacing a well just when i thought i wa about to get sick of the game for stagnating it introduced a new weapon or an interesting section which kept thing fresh throughout or to put it another way if metroid prime wa this series jurassic park this is it jurassic park dumber more actionoriented but briskly getting the job done the fact that i finished the game in about hour is actually a point in it favor it come in doe what it need to and get out before one can really get too tired of it think of it a the minute franchise threequel that doesnt compare to the original but is entertaining nonetheless and i think your expectation be set about rightthe game look just fine and sound just fine too the music isnt too memorable and the woman voicing samus is just awful but the rest of it is functional on an aesthetic level i would have like a couple of track that paid tribute to classic metroid tune but i criticized nintendo for stagnating so whatever im loathe to criticize a wii game graphic why beat a dead horse but there nothing wrong heredoes that spell a recommendation just barely and for the price currently listed on amazon i got it for if you cant get past the sexism i cant say it bother too much compared to the storytelling fumble by all mean stay away youll be fully justified but take metroid other m for what it is a dumb action game maybe later well be able to write off the story a noncanon too,3,3,4,2,2012,6,9,2,2012-06-09

2242,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000RHXD1O,perfectly honest im big fan military shooter occasion stomach a good fps halo metroid prime series tactical shooter like rainbow six vega of call of duty medal of honor whatever else little to interest i thought id check out game anyway and while still not genre and not a game id buy i did fun and got it unlike corruption combined a great atmosphere and story with control this seems like it fun to play to experience the whole packageits a wwii shooter so know mean invasion of normandy storming city covered rubble and debris and destroying uboats it not a particularly engaging story and time it feel more like youre going through the campaign mode to play the next mission rather than get more of the story though might find it intriguing and fan of war shooter could find it worthwhile thoughgraphically the game isnt exactly stellar even in progressive scan widescreen while it look fine on it and i didnt notice a lot of issue with detail or texture it doesnt really have that jawdropping feel that game or even stellar art design but of course war game shouldnt wrong in term of sound and while i dont have the benefit of a surround system the gunfire explosion and other element tended to be accurate and i even had that private ryanesque ringing in ear it muffled the sound voice acting is alright not exceptional but not laughable either so thats a good plusone of the thing many gamers anticipated with the introduction of the wii remote in regard to first person shooter and this game is certainly no slouch in fact it one of the best control experience ive had in the genre deadly on the battlefield never so fun and picking guy in the distance without that constant adjusting analog stick wa quite satisfying to say the least there also other element like peeking around corner tilting the nunchuk or throwing grenade by obviously a throwing motion with the wiimote wa quite immersive there even some nifty idea such a putting it on your shoulder to mimic carrying a bazooka or tilting it to turn radio dial to call headquarters wa wellhandledhowever i still have many nitpicks one some weapon such a the sniper rifle i found quite sluggish and aiming to hit the next guy felt strangely slow and going for the next guy took a lot more time than i wanted prompting me to exit the scope screen and just reposition and go and one i wouldve liked wa something like halo or resistance where just pressing one button could throw your grenade while it neater to press a to pull the pin and doing the throwing motion i wouldve liked immediate return to my gun rather than having to press on the dpad to go back and not just be stuck on grenadesis it buyworthy unless this genre is your thing than by all mean give it a play but you have game like rainbow six vega resistance or call of duty the orange box and even the wiis own metroid prime it wouldnt matter all much you missed this one but if you decide to give it a try than there is some fun to be had with this one,4,3,0,0,2008,5,3,2,2008-05-03

2264,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B006ZPAYD2,got first legobased game original star war game i fell love the series simple done with excellent incredibly fun execution couldnt help but fall in love with it it wa game that would appeal child easily and perhaps adult even easily recreating favorite scene the film followed suit with the lego indiana jones trilogy the complete adventure i still wanted nothing to with crystal skull when the first lego batman came i wa ecstatic and i played it my finger ready to fall my favorite comic character of time a lego game it wa probably my favorite of the lego series that i had playeduntil lego batman dc super hero came out that isi playing this game with a greater fervor of the previous game combined the biggest plus regarding this game the much more open worldness of the game it feel like a much bigger game and it certainly is in regard to character story and graphic the main story is much like the older and sillier teamup comic book in the best villain combine force to wreak havoc respective hero which is brings together batman robin and superman v the joker and lex luthor of course all of the inmate of arkham escape well so youre many of the villain of the first game a well such a twoface harley quinn the penguin catwoman etc but this isnt three character a the hero a you go deeper the story gameplay you get the of the current lineup of the justice league wonder woman green lantern the flash and cyborgyou still have the constant pumping of danny elfmans iconic score the batman film but nicely when youre in the open world scenario you choose to fly with superman you get the even more iconic john williams superman theme a far a sound design is concerned this is the first time that youre treated to actual dialogue in a lego game and the dialogue is aimed kid but for allages game the dialogue fit character very well and particularly the newscast the cutscenes very clever with the scroll at the bottom of the screen which is something the adult get a big kick out of the sound effect are terrific and you even have clancy brown returning to voice lex luthor a in the superman and justice league animated series sadly mark hamill kevin conroy tim daly thoughthe biggest attraction for me personally wa the amazing list of unlockable character character like aquaman hush ra al ghul hawkman and many many more are hiding around town waiting for you to build the golden door so that when you do get to the free play mode you pick and choose without always to rely on the suit also the dlc for this game which includes pack of five heroesvillains a piece is very inexpensive and is really for the big comic fansthere are nitpicky problem that i have with the game i wish that green lantern could shoot projectile from ring i wish the flash could run straight up building like i stated nitpicky but the problem i have with the game play is the flight mechanic are a little clumsy during the openworld segment and thats a pretty minor problem i know that many people play coop are having some problem with the ingame camera coop play but since i dont even have another controller honestly not something i could comment on ideally these game are designed to play with another person so that can join in the fun but im more of a solo player anyway so it never been a concern although my wife expressed interest in playing this game with me a did together with the first lego batman so i might looking for another controller soonfor right though lego batman is one fantastically entertaining game filled with action humor and joy and if youre a fan of the previous game this be a really easy buy,5,3,2,2,2012,8,19,2,2012-08-19

2266,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B0050SX9VO,first borderland great visual style making me want keep playing to see much stronger weapon could get it one the game wanted to get the platinum trophy and i still plan getting the game of the year edition just to finish the extra mission even all year later i really liked the game and the sequel announced i wa pretty excited borderland much right it hard to talk the gripe i with there so much good game of the year edition of the game wa recently announced and itll coming shortly it going to be a fullprice game since it come with everything and the kitchen sink far a dlc go youre on the fence about the game still though i highly recommend getting regular edition since it so cheap now i dont play that many fps game and when i tend to be unique the standard war game that i have anything i cant say that borderland change the way look the fps genre anything good lord i enjoy playing the heck out of this oneborderlands a relatively good story a dude named handsome jack ha taken over pandora and there a resistance called the crimson raider want to stop going with plan ill leave it at that since thing more deep here than they the first game and i dont want to ruin of the twist let just say that if played the first game youll see many familiar face and of are given real character this time around making a cast that easy to get attached to i did like the story for the part though most of the fun and time put the game is in side mission if you were to ignore them altogether you probably clear the game in the time it would take to do everything in the first run wheres the fun in that though the world of pandora ha a lot to see and shoot with bullet and loot chest everywhere bandit skag hyperion robot and more are just a plentiful and a usual there ungodly amount of gun to go it insane two gun can look identical and have the exact attribute in every category but one may have a slightly bigger magazine size or have better stability elemental weapon are back explosive fire corrosive electric and slag basically if you loved the first game there nothing here you wont likein the previous game you four different class this time around you can have to if you buy two of the dlc class but you still have access to the main from the get go they all play a little bit like the previous class though one is essentially the same thing axton the commando is pretty much roland the soldier ha a rad turret that can be deployed a his action skill use this to act a a distraction for enemy you take cover and recover or snipe them from a distance or just deploy it and shoot sidebyside zero the assassin would be mordecai the hunter i suppose with his skill tree a section that buff his sniper skill he also ha a unique ability that creates a hologram of to distract enemy while he turn invisible a the time run out for this mode zero do more damage want a great critical hit hit em at the last possible moment maya is another siren like lilith with a new ability ha a phaselock let levitate an enemy into an orb for several second making them a sitting duck it doesnt sound that good on it but when you look at her skill tree and realize that this ability can draw in foe cause everything around it to burn or melt and it can give maya health if the enemy is killed while phaselocked it quickly becomes clear that this skill rule and if the enemy is too strong like a bos or something they take raw damage instead of trapped finally there salvador the gunzerker do i need to say anything more than that he can use two gun at with his skill any two gun a sniper rifle and a machine gun sure a rocket launcher and a shotgun not two rocket launcher oh yeah he can do that too something great about the class this time around is that none of them are truly more efficient with a certain weapon type like they were in the previous game yes of skill tree ability help out with certain weapon type but x character isnt best with x gunthe game also ha much better graphic and the soundtrack is just a memorable too my absolute favorite track come from my favorite mission in the game the circle of slaughter survive round of an onslaught of bandit while this killer track bandit slaughter is playing seriously go search for that track and listen to it that sucker get me pumped for circle of slaughter every time and i never get sick of hearing ittheres so much more i could talk about with this game to try and convince you that it worth playing hopefully the low price get it a little more attention now are a few minor nitpicks i have though that keep it from being a star title first it the same issue i had with the last game and it backtracking i got sooooooo tired of going two area over and over for certain mission or having to walk back through an area because the car couldnt pas through an entryway or something it seemed like the fast travel station could have placed better or there could have been maybe two per map to cut on this having them so far apart doesnt add challenge it just get annoying a while and maybe it just me creeping up on in year or ive dealt with this kind of humor too much in other mediaits the writing a lot of the humor here will probably be enjoyed a lot of gamers i liked some of it too just not when it variant of the same thing repeated over and over there were only a few time where i really laughed out loud notably a robot who want to be human trying to think human thing had some line that were just plain comic gold aside from that most of the threat from enemy are the kind of thing youd hear from a middle schooler who just watched south park for the first time the only other thing ill mention is that character animation could have been much better when two maijor character in the town of sanctuary are going over something terrible that handsome jack did theyre having a heated conversation with great voice acting yet theyll just wave one hand around while the other hand is on their hip and the other character is standing there in a neutral stance you couldnt put a little more effort into these animation it nothing major at all just something that bugged me after a whiletiny complaint aside borderland is a blast and one of the more memorable title ive played this generation ill definitely be getting the game of the year edition when it come out im going to work on a new character,4,3,2,2,2013,9,15,2,2013-09-15

2308,A1A75WXC4FWT1F,B002E6XY6U,first spoiler review feel in order give this game proper review ill need to talk i marking i will reveal spoiler youll be aware of to avoid reading if dont care to hear about that said none of them involve end game anything particularly late in the gameim going to be front this fragile dream a fun game really tedious and be frustrating and of the gameplay involves fetch quest like the title of the review state even with all of it problem this is a game that all wii owner at least play yes it flawed but it so unique you owe to to play ityou play setovoiced johnny yong bosch amazingly gripping and tragic portrayal of the main character a young boy who life with an old man call grampa in observatory the game start a the old man passed away leaving behind a letter to seto telling to head west in search of human some time the start of the game something happened and almost all human killed in said event he leaf he encounter ren the first living human girl he ever seen seto doesnt leave a good first impression ren and run away him the story of the game involves you traversing the haunted of the ruined world looking renas mentioned this game gameplay is horribly flawed thats not to say it broken or buggy a everything work fine from a programming standpoint the problem come from the horrifically uninspired gameplay mechanic attack are essentially whack what is in front of you you cant move attacking reducing your already limited mobility you also get a slingshot weaponaimed with the wiimote in the game but i havent found this to be particularly useful except bos fight of their larger hit box the biggest problem with the combat in this game are the very small airborne enemy who will fly of your attack range for far long there also the problem with weapon breaking while probably realistic and understandable is extremely frustrating by and large you will be wandering around the dark landscape with a flashlight controlled by the wiimote this also work well a i problem aiming turning and the camera worked fine a well that said the game isnt very hard a you pretty much trip health and save point you can also meet a merchant you access a save point emphasis on the world can he show up on random and it seems like he almost programmed to stop whenever you dont want him there and just want to save and to never show up when you actually need himas mentioned before most of the objective involve fetch quest savaging various key for various door this is made bearable a it just an excuse to traverse the dark creepy and strikingly beautiful landscape the art is cel shaded giving the world a unique and well detailed look that reminds of a very well animated anime show that said i find one portion of the game where the frame rate dipped dramatically this game is technically survival horror but it le about frightened you are because of disturbing brutal and nightmarish creature but about the depressing cold atmosphere and the frightening undertone of the game a mentioned almost every human ha died in some kind of catastrophe and is where the real moment of brilliance come play in the game there something of a side gameplay element where you collect mystery item that you can identify when you head to a save point sometimes theyre just item weapon or money but often time is an object that carry with a person memory when brought back to the save point it will activate a monologue by that person recounting their last moment alive it very haunting and tragic and really help set the tone for this gamespoilersas ive said i feel i need to spoil a couple of thing to show just how brilliant this game can be at time by and large you are alone through out the game but not always the moment when you are alone are extremely unbearable to play through not because of any problem or advantage someone with you is but because of how bleak and depressing this game is without them the combat isnt exciting at all and the bleak dead world is hard to swallow the first person you meet who accompanies you is a computer named pf who you find in a train station pf will talk to you give you hint and is generally nice to around through the game sadly battery are dying and she dy very early in the game leaving you a gripping cut scene where she tell seto how happy she to have met him and how she wished could have spent more time together before dying it extremely painful actually and the gameplay once feel very lonely and depressing the next person you meet is a boy named crow who clearly isnt human he steal your pendant and you spend the next part of the game chasing him through an amusement park trying to get it back normally this would annoy me in any other game but it wa just nice to have someone there again even if all he is taunting you putting you in danger and generally a jerk he eventually leaf after you two become friend a he ha journey he on and youre back to square one again the way they juxtaposed the segment where you are with someone with the segment were you are alone is nothing short of a work of genius it add so much to the tone of the game the feeling and the theme of fighting against isolationspoiler endthis game narrative is truly haunting memorable and deep it much deeper what you usually get with video game this is a game that made me think it effected me on an emotional level that most game not despite the fact that the gameplay leaf much to be desired which to be honest help with the overall mood of the game being alone on a ruined earth would be neither fun glamorous when combined it work so well that it something im never going to forget combine this with a great voice acting cast great visuals and a gripping narrative you have a very solid title while this game isnt a must love and it going to be very off putting to a lot of people it still a unique game that i believe all wii owner really should play through onceprosgreat voice

2355,AD7IBJCYSJ9EE,B00002STPH,tale franchise one is sadly overlooked everyones played symphonia sure the others shame the game ive played pretty good but imagine game better the others is one of the weaker gamesgraphics minus the anime cutscenes this look like a game that could fit snugly snes cartridge it easier the eye than a polygonal mess doesnt look much different than tale of phantasia you know that the p is capable of graphic that are much prettier there excusemusicsound are quite a good track in this game the bassheavy battle theme the town music there isnt a bad track in this game the battle voice sound good a well and theyre thankfully in japanese all know bad english dub video game in the sstorycharacters a bad story the talking sword concept neat and the main protagonist stahn is likable the character join you are solid a well leon and rutee are welldeveloped and while the amnesia character is a bit cliche mary well done the other character are hit miss philia good garrs alright chelseas typical annoying yearoldgirl and bruiser while a good character to have on your party isnt developed all the story is pretty easy to follow but it nothing memorable also one thing didnt like wa that the main antagonist kept changing while it keep you guessing so doesnt give you a solid antagonist and the final one a bit underwhelmingalso wheres the spa scenegameplay for an early tale battle system it decent it d of course so it doesnt have that flow that later tale game have one thing i hate about the battle is that theyre too easy compared to other tale game i felt overpowered throughout the game and i didnt feel threatened the final bos another thing i dont like are the random battle while tale game today have the enemy on screen early one were random the game make you think at the beginning that the enemy will on the screen but it change to random problem is that there are too many it annoying to go a maze of a dungeon or a puzzle while getting pulled a battle every five secondsone interesting thing about the system are the swordians theyre the talking sword that four of the character obtain and are part of the story the sword are customizable through disc and can level making it interesting than buying a new weapon in every village you can also learn new move that are on tablet around the world depending on you and your swordians levelthe rest is your standard jrpg formula it all work well but there nothing too interesting one thing that could have potential wa the lens system enemy drop lens along gald and you can exchange your lens for gald but i always find not needing to use it because i usually have all the money i needanother pet peeve of mine is your way of travel you get a flying ship at the end so of the game you are traveling ship the dock will only take you to port town so there no exploring it also very annoying to accidentally choose the wrong town and it happens because you have to watch the ship go to the destonation on the world map it a bit tediousmost of the sidequests and minigames arent too interesting many sidequests involve the food system is something i kind of ignore in the tale series one sidequest that is good is a hidden dungeon that is based on the namco game the tower of druaga and it the hardest part of the game the minigames consist of thing a racing or tag so theyre nothing special but one of the better minigames is a quiz asked by phantasia character cless and arche which is pretty neat a few other sidequests help develop the character more but theyre nothing really spectacularoverall despite my nitpicking this is another good p jrpg to pick up especially you are a tale fan it doesnt have the mechanic of later tale game or the charm of phantasia but it a solid entry nonetheless the price of the game a bit steep and it not yet available on the psn but if you can find this game for a reasonable price add it to your collection,4,3,0,0,2012,1,26,1,2012-01-26

2358,AGKAIX7DSNSQW,B000CQIDTC,whooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh fist word mouth entered the train station halflife the xbox the graphic werent suberb even though i seen the video and over on my computer screen ign i wa still blown away halflife on the xbox wa incredible game and it wa kindof sad for find out that i could run the game on pc even better i didnt want to go out and by another game that wa exatly the same except for the two fact that graphic better on pc and that could also download multiplayer componant for the pc versionanyways like people i wa confused to an amount at the end of halflife i wasnt mad though you know valve pulling when leave you hanging on a cliff they making you thrive much a you to buy the next game that come out you can see what happenes they also pull off stunt of making you want the next game even by giving out little to information the next game when e pulled around valve said they would showing probably because the game wa a month away release anywaysokay the past two paragraph might possilby seemed pointless i kind of wanted to give you a backround of thing going my head i to give you my thought and review of one of the most amazing game i have ever played my life halflife episode one for of you are wondering this phrase not aftermath the box say aftermath on it i give you the answer so the next paragraph might take a little bit so you know the answer to that question skip the next paragraphit seems that valve decided not to make an expansion pack called aftermath this time they have decided to give u an episode no dont worry they are not giving u seizure though in a game like this you might expieriance one when i say episode i mean something like several part to a game in simple term while valve take the next year or so to create a third game if they they give a nice candy bar take around a year to create this candy bar if nibbled wisely will last you till you get second candy bar which be at the end of the year the idea of episodic game is quite smart and for this game valve make it seem quite sucessful and the storyline seems made for episodic contentokay that you know the purpose of episodic game and what they are let u continue the next pahse the review itselfstoryline last time i didnt give much of a good revealing to what happened in the storyline at the ending or the begining i wont reveal much this time either but for of you have not played any of halflife halflife is not required on your computer to run this game you can eiter listen to this and learn the little information that i will give you or ignore the following sentances you reach a long line just scroll youll find it in halflife you are sent by the gman who is your puppeteer in a way to city one of the few remaining earth city earth taken over by a ruthless group of creature known a the combine you fight your ally alyx vance dog dr kliner eli vance and a cool soldier named barney not the dinosauer you soon enough get to the citedel which is the creature and soldier combine soldier and ship are coming from it is the main base of operation for the combine confront the person who said that earth surrender to the combine dr wallace breen and defeate by destroying the combine portal reactor which result in a giant explsosion the gman reapears to take you awaysystem requirement halflife for the pc had one of the largest range for system requirement at the time for release it could run on a extremely high system but the minimal requirement were extremely low so any computer that used it could probably run it well valve continues to follow this requirement are exactly the same a halflife for the pc here a listminimal requirement ghz processor speed mb ram directx level graphic card window xpme mouse keyboard internet connectionrecommended requirement ghz processor speed mb ram directx level graphic card window xp mouse keyboard internet connectionmy computer easily reach near the recommended zone i have a processor so you probably shouldnt have to worry about this area muchyou will also need a dvd drive for this game if you buy it in store instead of downloading it from steamgraphics halflife on the pc stunned the world with graphic and valve it with a really spiffy update to of graphic while maintaining the same requirement a like i said they are really incredible graphic with amazing facial expression you should really try to put the character texture at high in the setting for this game at least the first chapter because it amazing to see alyxs face can show sign of fatigued sad worried happy amazed and so much more general texture are amazing at high but take large chunk out of that framerate of if it is at high sadly i had to put it at medium which look like the xbox graphic not too appealing hdr stand for high dynamic range which is hard to explain but i will try to tell you how greatly it work in this game take a sunny day at home and have a window shade covering half your window avoid letting any light in the room so it is quite dark compared to the rest of your home now stare at an area in the room that barely ha any light on it also make sure no light from the window is touching this surface continue to stare at it for about second when you are done look at surface near the window that ha the light from the window shining on it the area should look enlightened to a large extent to the point where you can only see pure light you cant even see detail on the surface clearly in due time it will not seem to bright anymore and you will see detail on that surface again this is one of the feature you will expieriance with hdr fully enabled in the game not every level includes hdr just to know i wa happy to know that my computer ran this game with full hdr without large portion of framerate drop whenever is a game that ha hdr it normally not run that well at all the rainbow six lockdown pc demo ran terribly with hdr and ghost recon advanced warfighter doe not even run on my computer i attempted to install the demo in the advanced graphic setting area in the menu there is star next to the setting that valve recommends you use in the game setting from what i know are all different for and every computer and they are quite trust worthy i get a very good balance of graphic and framerate with these setting the only dissapointment for me in these recomendations is that they say i should completely turn off antialiasing there is a large amount more on the graphic to this game but i feel i should press ongameplay an area large amount of people look at really the gameplay is very identical to the gameplay in halflife intense but with alyx fighting at your side throughout almost the entire game you get a different feeling there is a good variety of fun moment where alyx will do something scripted like get into a sniper position and cover you a you advance into the next area pop the head off of zombines more about later and more the gun training feeling that i mentioned in the halflife review on xbox is not integrated into the game a well this time but you dont really need it to be also the location you fight in have good variety this time like a dark scary low ammo power downed undergound highway full of zombines and zombie zombines are the name that alyx gave to combine soldier that have been taken over by headcrabs they are quite tough creature and take more one shotgun blast to kill unlike normal zombie youll also be fighting creature more often this time considering the fact that the combine defense if failing so there are more antlion and alike creature making their way into city another place you fight in is obviously city the gravity gun is still there and you get another fun time to have it supercharged but it will die off in time really this game wont last you long five chapter long and something around hour but valve give you a director commentary included you dont need to go out and buy a limited edition or anything you already have a commentary which is really fun and nice youll learn quite a bit about the clever mind of valve and it amazing how they create simple thing that you dont notice to give you a great game so the replayabillity is still in the medium level enough to last me till episode two at the end of the year also you beat the game there is a sneak peak trailer for the next episode which i will not say anything about not even my opinion on it so you get quite a bit with twenty dollar also loading time which came often on the xbox version but went by quickly are still here in halflife episode one this time the loading time happen le often but they last longer like a bathroom break longerokay moving on again because i wa running out of thing to write about the gameplaysound a good a halflife for pc halflife on the xbox had some strange differances with the sound than the pc version but it wa good also in this game if you set the video setting too high it is possilbe you might run into sound problem in the opening video but shouldnt happen also the stuttering problem in sound compared to what ive heard about the pc version of halflife seem to be fixedmusic ive said it before that im not much a person who writes about music halflife episode one still ha music that is strange but it still match the game enjoyablyai with halflife episode one the ai that wa used incredibly with halflife ha been enhanced to even smarter level than before theyll still pull off smart flankings zombines will charge you after you shoot them for the fist time they also at certain time pull out grenade and walk towards you while they hold it which is funny watch when you have a whole group of zombie around him friendly character ai is mostly noticed with alyx a doe a few cool instant kill move along with smart pistol shooting really valve said that they did not give alyx too many good fighting attack when shooting but what can be really cool is when you use your flashlight in the dark to let her see the enemy and she take out the bad guysthe game is halflife episode one the developer is valve this is the review and im summing up what ive typed for an hour and a half hope you enjoy this game and be amazed that much,4,3,14,5,2006,6,5,2,2006-06-05

2391,A1ZCFM6XK8WBE0,B000OLXX86,long time ago a galaxy far away bioware legendary creator dragon age star war knight of the old republic gave gamers first epic multipathed xbox rpg mass effect released much fanfare the heralded actionrpg hybrid allowed player to guide their customized main character commander shepard and recruitable multispecies crew a scifi journey of galactic proportion literally fast forward to presentday earth the mass waiting to affected the sequel a select of u missed the first portion of the story simply want ingame decision to carry to the successor decided to go back and try to save the original galaxy again the day of second impact fortunately while of the creak and crack of yesteryear have fissured eye sore since original release the old girl still largely got it countslets start with the probably the best reason to play through the original game again the highly shapeable story and the dialogue system on it rest although bioware fan recognize the company mo nearly every conversation and decision within mass effect allows the player to select response that lead to major and minor consequence depending on whether react to a situation with a coolheaded and diplomatic paragon response or a hotheaded and likely risky renegade option or anything in npc will come to either respect you or hate gut open to you or shut you out or ultimately be allowed to live or suffer a gruesome death although not every detail of commander shepard adventure will be changed via this system youll still fight the boss still be able to access the same shop and still have the same amount of selectable mission it major choice that the player forced to make that have become mass effect true legacy wont sugarcoat the situation some of the decision be quite difficult that reinforces the success that bioware ha in helping player establish meaningful connection to their ingame crew and support character their fate is quite literally in your controllergreased handsbut while youll delight in seeing the fruit of your dialoguebased decision chance are that the combat wont live up to your modernday expectation battle are carried out through a behind the shoulder thirdperson perspective with shepard leading two of his fellow squadmates with different trait and ability of course into a coverbased shooter army of robot mercenary and nogoodniks character ha assortment of different gun and special ability that allow an amusing combination of battle tactic your disposal you can suspend enemy in midair overload their weapon and disable their shield all before hit the ground unfortunately the cover system in which you try to stick a close to a wall a possible in hope of automatically latching onto it can only be described a serviceable at best especially with thirdperson shooter a gear of war setting a high bar over the past few year and while certain character class such a the soldier or vanguard will have little trouble disposing of the legion of seemingly crackshot enemy despite this flawed mechanic others will be doomed to restarting the same battle multiple time due to an overexposed limb add to this a fairly crude checkpoint system and you could find repeating the same minute battle over and over again complete with unskippable cutscenes and loss of saved player setting suffice to say your learning curve may varyits also surprising again given it release well mass effect graphic still hold up while it certainly doesnt represent the bleedingedge of texture and polygon that it once are still quite a few aweinspiring moment to be found within the galaxy especially the last few mission and although some may blame unsynchronized voice and mouth movement on a general lack of polish and they might be right i find more willing to stick the rather uninspired sidemissions and exploration quest into that unfortunate possibility bucket matter the task might be whether it to rescue a sibling purchase a certain good or procure information for someone everything revolves around either lengthy although admittedly welldone conversation or raid on generic building wiping out baddie for cash thats all but worthless with nearly every worthwhile weapon and piece of armor procured through chest along the main story arc there even le reason to explore the dozen of additional planet littered throughout the galaxy of empty wasteland that contain some sort of mineral or artifact good only for cash or obsessive collection reliefbut despite the janky unbalanced combat the slightly outdated visuals and the largely uninteresting sidequests mass effect still manages to win over the majority of player through it thoroughly engaging story and dialogue system it proofpositive that giving player a greater array of choice within their game will allow them to connect more strongly to it especially the consequence are interesting heartfelt and permanent it little wonder fan are excited for the sequel want to see how our action will continue to affect all of our story lack of polish be damned but while the new model is right around the corner dont hesitate to take the ol gal out for a ride if youre interested

conspiracy a sensitive incident a refinery in alaska lead investigation agent gabe logan and covert team uncover is what they expected and thing dont add they dig deeper slowly adding piece to the puzzle of a deadly conspiracy in order to keep up the story important to find hidden evidence on level and read the file in inventory they provide essential detail to story progress without they arent necessary it sometimes difficult to figure the who and why of what is going on the twist and turn come fast and apart the occasional unaccounted for gap due to missing intel the story is solid deception abounds and dark mirror feel like a mystery past tactical espionageoriented syphon filter gamesthis time around the mission presented in smaller piece with simpler design sit and play one part of a mission in minute are checkpoint within bitesized area at critical location you never to backtrack far you die something result in mission failure the level are fairly straightforward and linear it doesnt feel constrained and there is room for tactical experimentation a well a secret to findmost of the time you moving sneaking shooting aiming and taking cover stealth always a staple of syphon filter and it is well represented in dark mirror thing quietly often ensures resistance along your path is lighter however stealth is not necessary in case and there is severe punishment for attempting it and caught you can get a rush of anticipation a you sneak around your quarry or you can get a rush of adrenalin when they spot you and assault you full force however you want to play it dark mirror will accommodate youwhen you do get trouble you can take cover along wall or behind obstacle is a new addition to syphon filter gameplay and it isnt a new gaming concept it ha been done properly not sticking your neck out needlessly can save your life but with dark mirror fairly easy difficulty you can usually opt to just stand in the open and fire if youre quick on the trigger this allows casual gamers to enjoy the action while allowing more tacticallyminded individual to be more deeply involved in the battlefieldenemies are unpredictable yet intelligent many time using cover a you would when they have you outnumbered they take advantage of the situation to put pressure on you and ferret you outthere is a nice assortment of weapon and device for gabe and company to use pistol shotgun assault rifle sniper rifle submachineguns experimental weaponry explosive grenade etc at one time you can carry one sidearm one submachinegun one rifle sniper or otherwise the experimental agency rifle you carry at time a melee weapon and an explosive the experimental rifle shoot dart of various type explosive poison gas or electric shock firearm have varying attribute and fire mode so are better under certain circumstance generally speaking though most any gun can get the job done for you so it almost never a matter of not the right tool for the job with all of these

three different mode night vision infrared and electromagneticarmor and medkits are place around the level and provide a quick refresh particularly intense areasthe graphic are neat and clean while the p can push out more dazzle than is presented in dark mirror this game succeeds in looking fantastic in it simplicity if youre used to the highend cg cutscenes of late you may be a little disappointed in the movie dark mirror provides but the ingame action still look goodthe sound is decent with some good voice acting and a lot of spoken line play cant help but feel there could be a little more oomph to the gun and some more environmental sound but again dark mirror succeeds in it simplicity the music is provided by several composer including the ubiquitous mark snow nothing terribly rousing here but it keep pace with the high and low of the actiondespite these easy to swallow portion and an emphasis on simplicity there is a lot on the table to enjoy and dark mirror offer hour of story playtime in addition there is a mission mode you can replay level and earn rating in tactical area a headshot stealth kill use of rifle dart survivability and knife skill for your performance you are awarded badge of merit and these patch unlock additional weapon ability such a increased health and new bonus level earning full rating for each level usually requires you to play through it a more time each time focusing on a different tactic due to the quickfire nature of the mission this is quick and fun but can eat up a lot of time in the long run making dark mirror very replayabledark mirror is quite enjoyable it doesnt shoot itself in the foot by catering to casual or hardcore action gamers instead it allows for and so admirablyon a final note dark mirror brought to the p after being made for the psp everything wa designed for quick portable gaming in mind this account for the short mission structure somewhat easy gameplay it much easier to move and aim with a p controller and allround simplicity a opposed to more complex game like socom or metal gear solid fortunately dark mirror is a shining example that satisfying gameplay and quality content dont necessarily imply complexity,4,3,7,7,2007,12,10,1,2007-12-10

2452,A2HX83TUM905UD,B001CRM3RI,title review perhaps quite misleading is little gore grand theft auto chinatown war easy to lose sight of however youve mowed gang member stolen car pilfered their narcoticsanyone familiar the franchise find little of this surprising and veteran may find the scenario a bit redundant remember year ago gta iii released the playstation and the time i wa entranced the game it appeal wa unlike that of mario in that it focus on nonlinear and openended gameplay set apart title the similarity the part end there howeveri think there few user of this website are not familiar with the convention of grand theft auto ill skip ahead and reiterate that proclaimed by critic and user across the board this is not gta lite and anyone who is a fan of this series owes it to to play chinatown war not the game accurately adapt the sandbox gameplay seen in previous entry it also make a few addition that are successful enough to probably appear in the next console releasein particular the drug trafficking feature is satisfying and lends to the portable format of the game to elaborate buying and selling narcotic is quick satisfying and actually the most effective way to make money in the game since it take le three minute to plan and execute a drug deal i imagine it likely that dealing depressant coke acid and the like in chinatown war will serve a ample entertainment for waiting for a train not to mention it a lot safer than actually becoming a drug kingpin see breaking badhave faith skeptic and grand theft auto purist for technical aspect of the game range from excellent to outstanding adapting to the control will take not but minute for anyone familiar with the playstation title and perhaps notably longer for those taking a first trip to liberty city visually the game truly must seen to be believed i wholeheartedly encourage reader who havent seen the game in action to hit youtube and watch a few gameplay video immediately i firm in belief that grand theft auto chinatown war could pas a a lowgrade dreamcast title graphicallyits important to make note that gamers who not care for this franchise will not likely be converted by the d entry additionally i would not recommend the game to child or teen seventeen any other gamer with a pulse would be missing on exceptional gaming experience by skipping chinatown war,5,3,1,1,2009,4,12,2,2009-04-12

2462,A3J4ZG0O2YGVKZ,B003B3V0MA,avid fan word general decided upon learning of existence purchase classic book nintendo dsfirst thing first of the book included in the software of copyright people invariably scoff the idea of paying actual money for particularly since legally for free place like certainly valid point feeling on the matter are thus i like to read i terribly fond of reading book on the computer had i an ereader a the kindle the nook might be little reason for to purchase a title such a this however decent ereaders are still relatively expensive there the cost of a cover or case to help protect the thing and possibly the optional protection plan etc without used one at length im not sure whether or not would be worth it to me to drop the coin required for such a purchasesince i already a d making a small purchase like classic book is a much easier pill to swallow in order to dip my toe in the water of ebook readingwhen the title start there is a pleasant and soothing tune playing a an owl fly across a row of book and settle on the nontouch screen to watch the owl also serf another feature the thought of choosing to read the book available is somewhat daunting you can ask the owl for a recommendation hell ask you a question what you want to read length genre reading level etc and make a suggestion based on answersyou can also get recommendation the online ranking you connect to the nintendo wfc you can update the ranking on the book and there will be sticker applied to various book are the highest rated in several category romantic most humorous most scary best overall book etc this is a neat little feature but wholly unnecessary particularly since most people wont want to keep going online to update the ranking and again whilst connected to nintendo wfc you also have the option to download ten additional book to the software immediately integrate the bookshelf there a little dl on the bottom of the spine of book so you can see which one are hardcoded in the software and which are dlcyou can recommend book youve finished reading them or after youve skipped ahead to the last page and finished the book if youre just eager to give a high rating to your favorite book you get to rate it from to and then pick an adjective that describes it the adjective correspond to the category a book can be stickered inthere are really two thing that are important in a title such a this and thats the quality of the book and the quality of the interfaceive typed up a list of the book at the bottom of this review and there is quite a large variety available across all genre which is a plus author ranging from louisa may alcott to oscar wilde and the book themselves going from league the sea to wuthering height there is literally something enjoyable for practically anyone even remotely like to readthe one big problem i had with the book is that there are sporadic typo to be found a an example there a passage in the jungle book which erroneously say hoy instead of boy on page if you are using the standard font size theyre not everywhere but i found a couple in the jungle book and elsewhere ive only read a few book in the game however they are offputting you find them and it put a bit of a taint on what is otherwise a very solid titleas for the interface it is so intuitive that practically anyone could figure it out within a matter of second however there also a tutorial that play the first time you start the game which you can skip if you so desire you hold the d sideways like a book clever and you can use either the button or the screen to turn the page the dpad or face button depending on whether youre a righty or lefty can be used to turn the page left or right and you can optionally set the shoulder button to change page a well on the screen tapping the left or right side of the touch screen will turn the page back or forward you can also slide the stylus across if you want a realistic pageturning motionyou can set up to three different bookmark per book this is nice if you have a particular passage that you want to refer to later or if you have multiple people reading one cartridge if you want to remove a bookmark just go to that page and take it out or you can simply place it somewhere else in the book and it will move automatically you dont have to go and pick it up you can set it somewhere else which is nicethe font size can be changed two setting and i found to be quite easy to read there also several background ambient noise choice you can use some of them are a little unpleasant actually both the music selection of classic and easy listening sounded a little harsh and synthesized for me to enjoy reading but i found some that very relaxing and actually enhanced the reading experience summer night is my favorite but moving train and park are both good tooits obvious that a lot of work went into making the interface a smooth and a intuitive a possible and it really show it extremely well thought out though it not perfect one glaring omission is the lack of a dictionary to look up unfamiliar word i understand that the kindle a builtin dictionary for just such a purpose with all the book from or prior it is not uncommon to run into many unfamiliar word particularly from the international author such a tolstoy kipling or hugo secondly there no search functionality unless youve bookmarked the page youre stuck hopping from page to page looking for whatever phrase or quote you wanted to find another feature that would have nice though it isnt strictly necessary is a texttospeech feature also included in the latest model of the kindle synthesized speech ha made many advance the past decade and although it not perfect it would be nice to be able to turn on a texttospeech function if i wanted to listen to a book whilst browsing amazon for exampleone of the interesting thing you might notice is a lack of an esrb rating for this title apparently due to the content being entirely literaturebased this title not require any age classification granted it doesnt affect the software in any way but it might be a bit of a collector oddity for this reasonso a i mentioned at the top of the review i basically purchased this a an experiment to see whether i would get any use out of an ereader before i whip out the wallet and buy one so the experiment go well i just placed my order for a kindleand now here a list of book included with the software book with an asterisk are not on the cartridge but are available for download via nintendo

2471,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00002SVET,give donkey kong land rating of ive decided update review four year later my original review extremely negative not only wrong also a bit disrespectful well i apologize thatyes i wa hating donkey kong land pretty hard and heavy my original review and i even reached a boiling point i said id never touch game againmy reason for immature episode of anger wa simply because i preferred the donkey kong country series and donkey kong land felt like a cheap imitation comparison however playing dkl i realize the error of my way i wa completely wrong to dismiss game originallyfirst of the level in donkey kong land not a direct ripoff of the one in dkcsure the temple water and factory theme make appearance but not fair for to say are direct ripoffs of the level in donkey kong country the level actually designed completely differentlyby different i mean the level are not trying to like the one in the dkc series all instead the game maker took advantage of the popular theme in donkey kong country and used theme to create something else entirely completely different objective and whatnotin word the gameplay involving collecting banana stomping on enemy head and everything else exactly the same a in the donkey kong country series the level are not the same a the one in the dkc seriesim actually really surprised that the water stage for example are significantly fun they are in the dkc series theyre also much harder actually the water stage feel twice a long in comparison to the one in dkc is rather odd considering the dkc series appeared on the super ne the console where idea were normally utilized to full potential seems like the water stage were more thought out in this gamethe stage where a squid is chasing through a deep underwater maze is definitely really creepy because never stop chasing you but more importantly water stage are really exciting and challenging im really surprised significantly more fun and challenging the water and temple stage are in comparison to the one in the dkc serieson the flipside however the jungle stage are definitely worse than the one in dkc this is because theyre usually quite short and not much attention to stage design wa given compared to other stage in the gamethe bos fight are really simple because the strategy required to defeat is usually something extremely basic and easy to figure out but thats a minor flaw that doesnt mean the final bos fight is a cakewalk though he really test ability to move quickly during final phasemany of the enemy the dkc series return in addition to plenty of new one bee rat snake and crocodile are back other type of enemy a floating crab spiky fish flying pig tornado hey they mine a well be enemy and snake on rope yes thats right are new and exciting addition rambi and expresso are back but winky and enguarde are not perhaps that explains the water stage are longerone big flaw however is probably due to a game boy limitation remember in donkey kong country whenever you run and jump you actually go pretty farwell in donkey kong land whenever you run and jump for reason donkey kong and diddys animation slows drastically you almost hang in mid air which mean you never actually leap in the air far which mean you basically to stand right next to the edge of a cliff in order to make it across to the next platform it seems youre holding a barrel you jump a bit though weird either way a while youll learn to adjust to it fine so it wont present much of a problemoh and donkey kong doesnt slap the ground anymore thats slightly disappointing because i used to like slapping banana out of the dirtthe reason the game is challenging is because enemy are placed in spot that sneak on you pretty quickly in other word enemy probably be walking where you least expect also the game is stingy with up balloon for some reason there a distinct lack of banana compared to dkc which mean getting of them for extra life definitely doesnt happen a frequently compared to dkcsome of the level are really strange the mine cart level are gone and in their place are level involving these platform that you ride these are quite possibly the hardest stage in the game especially this one you will encounter later on where you have to jump in the air in order to make the platform move in the direction you desire youll see i mean here when you play the gamethe graphic are really good seriously considering this is a game boy game the only flaw is actually one that make me feel like im nagging when i mention it the graphic are in black and white thats basically the only difference compared to the donkey kong country version oh and the music is actually a lot more melodic and creative too i love just every single theme song game boy game have boring music not this onein the end the number one reason this game is so good is because and every level is positively loaded with fun thing to one moment youre collecting banana and coin the next youre either jumping through barrel riding up and down rope swinging around jumping up and down on tire riding platform to faraway place tossing barrel defeating all kind of beautifully animated enemy the fun seriously never end this game rulesoverall a pretty solid game that i definitely didnt appreciate when it wa first released nowadays i play donkey kong land and say it just really fun and not a ripoff of donkey kong country,4,3,6,1,2006,6,22,2,2006-06-22

2524,A1HX04JEY9MR3,B0009S4UOK,good firstperson shooter there shooter contain story captivates player enough blast a dozen level shooting dodging grenadelobbing those level generally multiple objective that are varied bombing a structure to rushing a certain location and killing everything from point a to point b staying alive those shooter are generally accompanied attractive graphic and pulsepounding music the xbox version of quake doesnt have many of those quality a terrible game it one of the least impressive shooter ive played yearin quake brainless campaign youll strap the armor of the space marine matthew kane a member of the rhino squad that attacking the evil strogg on home planet the biomechanical beast are foul dirty and ruthlessand a small twist near the middle of the game show and corporal kane dirty the strogg thought that nice raven to throw a truly unexpected story twist but i never really found the rest of the game to be interesting least the second half of the campaign is fast frantic and intense it preferable to the first half overall the game is hour long clocking in at or near the shooter averageits the gameplay that let and shaking head quake play like a good first person shooterfrom the fragging is so ridiculously generic from the start of the game the very end will say it just quake traditional gameplay i say it boring youll pick progressively stronger and better gun but at the time enemy get a little faster a little bigger a little deadly there a balance established strong weapon and strong enemy however of the action consists of running forward throughout similar room finding the strogg and shooting until fall and their corps disappear they dont move around much at they often dont even try to evade your fire and they dont try to outsmart you in the slightest bit usually theyll stand in place move towards you and shoot you without taking much cover or attempting to get around you for an easier kill a of the enemy have different tactic but tactic are usually just slight variation from the standandshoot or runandslash strategy it disappointing game like call of duty have impressive intelligencethe gun you get can be pretty cool but i discovered that almost anything can be killed quickly and effortlessly with a few wellplaced shotgun blast or an entire clip of machine gun ammo even near the end of the game the enemy dont take much cover is an example set for the playerrunning around and mindlessly shooting doesnt have many repercussion it isnt necessary to hide very often because of this even inexperienced gamers can plow through this game action you have to play through this game play it on a hard difficulty setting unless you simply want to cruise right on through it the thing that break up the action even the slightest bit are a few vehicular distraction which are admittedly a lot of fun one of them put you on the back of an onrails truck shooting the strogg with your weapon the next throw you the cockpit of a hovering tank you can quickly fire off missile and pound the opposition with machine gun fire the most exciting and last vehicle is the walker which can use lockon missile and machine gun fire to rapidly take down enemy these distraction are a lot of fun and it a shame that the rest of the game is so genericmultiplayer on and offline isnt more interesting the singleplayer have a robust fastpaced frantic set of game turn out to be pretty dull and generally unexciting eight people can join up in a single game and of course you can frag in deathmatches but there isnt anything that impressed me in the slightest bit all these year ive heard about how much fun quake can be in term of multiplayer and im let down gameplay that simply isnt interesting not to mention xbox live is very inconsistent and the alreadylow frame rate which ill mention momentarily make quake more frustrating to play than it ever should have beenvisually it is very difficult to classify quake there certain part the game that i wa admittedly impressed with raven choice for art and style there is a lot of detail throughout the environment from bloodsplattered wall to gear and mechanism scattered around the various room even the nicelylit interior location which compose most of the game are interesting corridor shooting isnt nearly repetitive when the bulk of the graphical factor isnt stale and boring on the other hand player model are very generic and almost every marine look like partner one marine might have different hair and another might have a different skin color the model also look so jagged without a highresolution screen that it appears they have spike or fur quoting a friend quake cactus graphic the effect are extremely dull whether it the nintendo calibur muzzle flash or the fire and smoke effect that would look at home in a generic playstation game the music isnt very good either where perfect dark zero set a mood with it tune quake nothing to pump the player up for any battle or confrontation it not epic it not exciting and it fails to impress me at all the voice acting is alright but the dialogue is so cliched and generic that it cancel out any sort of impressing aural qualityoverall quake is a big disappointment what wa supposed to be a visually stunning fastpaced pulsepounding shooter end up one of the most dull launch title on the xbox the story is interesting enough to pull you through hour of generic and brainless action and the vehicular distraction are a quick and effortless blast but thats about the furthest quake go if youre a quake fan i wouldnt question you if you rented the game but id have to frown down on anyone decides to buy this game there isnt enough here in term of depth or new modern shooter attraction pick up perfect dark zero or call of duty instead believe me you wont regret it,2,3,13,9,2005,12,21,1,2005-12-21

2554,A1YEPFLLH42OU1,B000E0XX9Q,someone loved old infinity engine crpgs baldurs gate icewind dale planescape torment quite liked the original neverwinter night despite issue pretty high hope game fact i got pretty much the day it released probably tell the date this review that it rather failed arrest attention nwn game that by right great unfortunately it suffers serious unavoidable basic flaw that totally cripple the fun factoras one can expect the game engine and graphic new and improved you can certainly tell by much longer it take to load area and how big a drag on system resource this game becomes even current system the time of this writing lag at some point in the game and machine is borderline you can expect major issue even if you have everything turned to minimum in fact nwn is taxing on your pc a lot of game that look a whole lot better and on that note it actually look a whole lot better than the old nwn character model are especially bad and you say thats a game engine limitation check the witcher sometime it us the one i dont know how obsidian could have neglected character appearance it probably the critical visual factor in a game like this sound and effect are fortunately a lot better and this make it somewhat tolerable in the multimedia departmentthe gameplay is sort of a mishmash baldurs gate and nwn you have more control companion and can some thing like determine how they level control directly in combat if you wish unfortunately you probably have to take direct control the ai is absolutely atrocious you thought the pathfinding in baldurs gate wa bad it look positively brilliant compared to this nwn is a new low character getting stuck behind or on empty terrain for reason running right a room filled trap not attacking enemy directly in front of them spellcasters choosing to melee instead of casting healer not healing party member that are on the verge of death the list go on and on fortunately there some free downloadable hack that go quite a way towards fixing the ai and if you want to progress the game at anything approaching a reasonable pace are absolutely mandatory on additional note you cant multiclass of your companion in the campaign all you can do is assign point and feat is a shame your main character can pick up to total class though the level cap of limit you somewhat limited in term of viabilitythe nwn campaign an overhead map that may bring back memory of baldurs gate however the campaign more or le shoehorn you into going into certain place in a certain order and isnt a whole lot le linear than the old nwn there some halfhearted attempt at side quest including some companion quest and a phase you get to manage your castle but it nothing like baldurs gate extensive character development and exploration if youve played bg youll end up sorely disappointed for a it look like nwn is headed in the same direction and it all just sort of stop or get dumbed down to boredom it an improvement over nwn in this regard but it ha a long long way to go to get to the level of even the original baldurs gate a far a the campaign story go it pretty runofthemill no real surprise not particularly imaginative in short a whole lot like the lackluster original nwn campaign ive yet to try out the expansion for this game and itll probably some time before i do on account of how little i enjoyed this campaign even on a loot note there not a whole lot to be had i started noticing a lot of duplicate item halfway through and checking the total list with the toolset i wa appalled by how item are in the game not to mention how dumb most look most of them arent even provided with any interesting background just generic statstheres a few additional and new feature that have potential the game us the dd rule and is somewhat more streamlined than the original it still take a bit of slot juggling to figure out stack with what but a lot of the weirder thing have been simplified or removed there are new race including some that are more powerful than the standard one and thus incur a level penalty not a good thing considering there level there a new base class in the campaign the warlock and a decent collection of prestige class unfortunately due to the cap and the fact that you cant multiclass your companion you probably wont get to experience most of the latter unless you either cheat or keep replaying the campaign which a noted is not exactly great fun there also some new item creation feat and skill though in practice i found them to be difficult to keep track of and not a whole lot of use anyway there also attempt at replay value in the campaign using the new influence system but most of these come very late in the game and dont have a very serious impact on what actually happens anyway there also not a whole lot of motivation for what few optional quest there are since most are quite boring and a with the original nwn youll hit the cap before you finish either wayas for character customization you can alter appearance name skill feat and class in general you really want to stick with one type of class eg if you choose to be a spellcaster you should stick with that and related prestige class trying to get your character to do everything make you pretty weak all around since this isnt an epic campaign then if you dont really care about a powerful main character do whatever the game isnt particularly hard and your companion can probably take up the slack a with nwn you can use skill in some dialogue choice and world action though aside from bluffintimidate these are pretty darn rare in particular skill like listen survival and intimidate are rarely used they might a well have just taken them out some reviewer have said that the game favor melee class but this is definitely not true you get out of the noob stage in fact i would say spellcasters are favored in the latter two third of the game on account of how many huge pack of weak monster you encounter nothing like aoe to clean that up right quick you can rest almost anywhere and it only take a few second which make memorized spell limit a nonissue unless you get into a really drawnout fight not common that aside seeing spell go is one of the only real highlight of the game combat system weapon based attack are so boring you dont even watch after a whilei do believe nwn ha potential and the expansion may manifest that so could player made content since the toolset allows you to change practically anything however the outofbox nwn campaign is barely an improvement over the nwn original campaign that one fortunately got better with expansion but the original wa a bore and really didnt hold my attention it look rushed unfinished in graphic and quest design and ha ton of new angle that could have been really cool if they actually done right the simple sad fact is that there a lot of better rpgs out there and have been since nwn release which is it took so long to get through this game in that light i really cant recommend this title,2,3,4,4,2009,12,8,1,2009-12-08

2579,A3BPA8OCXCEW2I,B007A7UJ4S,plenty review telling awesome game part are true id like drop note thing the game annoyed playing since review seem to that lousy ai frankly the ai of teammate leave lot to desired you seemingly change the action they can cant take in battle and only you control the people character top of that the lack of option the game give you setting action to take are frustratingly low invariably it came to two choice for me either tell to take action or watch them waste all mana needlessly in the most awful situation ie using special move when enemy is about to die to the next melee swing etcyoud imagine that setting a character to keep u healthy would mean they would conserve mana to heal ala they use most of it to attack and when you need heals you end most if not all of it low capture rate im sure youve read or heard this game a pokemon aspect to it the game ha different monster for you to capture and for and every one of them the only way to capture them is esther on roughly a chance the monster be captureable this is a stark contrast to pokemon you can throw a pokeball at anything you want at any time be prepared to spend hour sometimes trying to capture something specific with alternative except to pray that one of fight youll finally be able to capture it melee attack can be blocked not in a traditional sense in with a shieldthat would be fine but any melee familiar you use will invariably run clipping issue trying to reach the mob supposed to attack meanwhile it swing away at the air in front of it missing everything it can reach the mob one would think clippingpathing issue would be resolved the game released but apparently this ignored aoe attack interrupt everything in battle for the uninitiated aoe is area of effect meaning attack that hit everything on the screen whenever your character and their familiar any attack or even heals that hit everything at a earsplitter you are treated to a minicutscene of it happening what this doe unfortunately is it wipe any move that wa cast but animation not finish for example if you trying to charm a mob and esther harpplaying animation did not finish yet and an aoe spell went it effectively cancel your charm attempt and you to do it all over for charm there is no cooldown but for spell such a swaines trick shot there areand yes getting your move cancelled this way put in on cooldown this is highly annoying over the course of the game a a lot can happen in a few second every battle and your move put on cooldown arbitrarily is horrible lackluster ending not necessarily a flaw but man wa it disappointing if youre playing this game with the hope that at the end of it youll be treated to some studio ghiblianimated ending with some insight on what the character are up to since you beat the game youll be sorely disappointed there is a semblance of that but it is short and abbreviated that it left a lot to be desired dont know with all the effort they put into the game that it would be so hard to give u a like a two minute animated ending or sowasnt this part of why studio ghibli wa on board in the first placenow none of these thing really detract the game overall but they are annoyance you will have to deal with when playing this game overall this game is still every bit a charming refreshing and fun a all the other review say they are are two positive i absolutely loved about the game the best part about this game is it brings back the world map and exploration to rpgs something that many new rpgs take for granted these day many are so linear they feel like youre playing candyland proceeding from point a to point b along a single path without a choice this game ha an actual world map ton of hidden area and treasure many sidequests and distraction and it is something that feel so refreshing since it is so rare these day to find a rpg with these element still intact the attention to detail here is stunning is why i dont understand how the flaw ive listed could happen when you visit the winter isle your character actually start shivering in the snow your character are eventually given snow clothes and snow clothes appear when you fight in snowy areaseven your profile picture next to your hpmp bar are updated with the new graphic it is easy to skimp on thing like this in a game and no one would probably notice it but i for one found this to be yet another refreshing and beautiful aspect of the game and that is what make a good game greati sincerely hope that studio ghibli doe another rpg in the future hopefully with these issue fixed this game ha restored faith that the classic jrpgs of the past are not dead and when done correctly can still be a masterpiece of a game newer style rpgs have it place and are fun but to play this game in this day and age reminds me of why i bought my p and why i fell in love with video game in the first place,5,3,4,3,2013,3,5,1,2013-03-05

2609,A3VBVORJ38FPOU,B000FKBCX4,well figured game could use review someone actually played quite a bit unlike review from people who either a played it b complaining securom c have played it minute prepared review anyway the game actually quite fun start the ocean whichever little critter you make and swim around and eat smaller fish pretty simple and im sure youve all played a game like anyway you get bigger and eat bigger fish get new part you add the specie youre creating and voila the cell stage you move on to the next stage depending on decision you made in the cell stage you might classified a carnivore herbivore or omnivore anyway youre going to get to add some new thing to specie add a couple leg arm bigger mouth etc and remove thing you longer need since youre the water now you go around and you can either befriend other specie or kill off your choice i chose to kill of them off though i tried to befriend them first some are easy to befriend some not much one of the thing i kept getting is specie that wanted to pose for them i hadnt found the right part around the planet yet to give me that ability in fact didnt find them right after that stage this is really easy stage you get going youll hibernate a couple time to new nest and find some specie to either befriend or make extinct most of the new part you get for your specie are going around the planet and finding bone very easy and some are clumped like in one area make for alot of addons for your specie after you finish this stage youll move on to the tribal stage this stage is kind of like command and conquer style for of you that have played it youre going to be controlling your specie from a birdseye view default view you can move the camera though and interact with other tribe your specie now have the ability to make fire build hut collect food to keep the camp etc however pretty much the basis a the creature stage go around and either kill off other tribe or befriend them the way you played the previous stage also ha an affect on this one itll classify you a an aggressive specie friendly specie or adaptable specie aggressive of course one that like to kill specie off and friendly one that like to befriend with adaptable being in the middle you start off with creature from your specie in your camp one being the chief and two being workersfighters whatever that may be you can then add member by creating baby though you can only have a maximum of tribe member until you kill off other tribe to increase your amount i havent finished this stage yet but it pretty good believe are two more stage after this and ill try and edit review i find out i dont really think this game ha to much replayability sure you can create new creature and all but the only difference will really be changing to a herbivore or something it would be stupid not to say that every time you make a new creature you are going to give it the same part a your previous a youll want the best stats though you can form it in different way it will always kind of look alike another thing i dislike is the fact you can change your character so much dont limit the customization at all im not talking about the first time but once youve looked like let say a dinosaur the next time youre in edit mode you can make some kind of legged specie with eye wing completely change the color take away the tail and though thats what the player want to i guess thats fine but it just weird my specie actually went from looking like a horse to looking like a trex of course i guess that my fault but still anyway still a pretty decent game though i might be biased a i no idea this game wa in the work for the last year or whatever i just heard about it like two or three week ago i think when they released spore origin on itunes and i wanted to check it out so i wasnt expecting a genrechanging game like most people now about securomit really suck yeah but i guess have to live with it or just stay away until they are forced to change it i actually install securom game on my computer that isnt connected to internet and if i have to connect it for activation i do and then disconnect it still a pretty good computer and i dont use it for anything else i have this computer i myself got the game for about because my friend got it for work so thats probably another reason i gave it a try it not the greatest game ever made but it not that bad either for all the hype ive heard and read that this game ha had i would be pretty mad to if this wa what i ended getting but a i said i had no expectation so it wa fine with me i know my opinion would be different if i had waiting year for it,4,3,149,32,2008,9,7,2,2008-09-07

2624,A2WGXE8JPTWYUL,B007WQOIGW,let start saying ive read comic seen every episode the tv show huge fan of the walking dead series written and visual formthis game blew me away storytelling tactic insanely original the character are beautifully craftedand truly feel like a gaming experience a game itselfill lay the pro and con of the gameprosgreat story literally almost cried the endamazing character character a beautifully crafted arc and really become lee everett in the gamegraphics are well done although a bit laggy the graphic are fun and interestingalways surprise i feel like the comic sometimes draw certain story out much and the show definitely part of season example i never felt that in the gameconscontrols isnt fps it an actionadventure game like batman arkham city for example it a point and click for action type game even i found it hard point and click at the right moment due to poor button configurationlagging the graphic tended to blotchy and buggy a lot of the time cutscenes and sometimes during the game but this didnt take away the overall experience of the gamelike i said this isnt the best game ive ever played but it the best experience ive never i invested much a character character into a story or a video game world you become the character you play and you definitely build relationship it fun exciting tearjerking sometimes annoying but believe me you not want to miss out playing this itll take hour of time max and every second is worth it except second youre walking back and forth trying to find an appliance to open a door,5,3,3,1,2012,12,26,1,2012-12-26

2626,A2B40ERM3QI6E,B001AWBYNE,finally got play three mode game to offer since hot issue whether this game cod wwii wheel i think thing needed to cleared graphic this game doesnt look much better detailed cod the difference much fancier setting lead to seemingly better graphic cod took place droll setting modern day terrorist get interior decorator real the fact the matter look practically the thats a no for ww co they could least improved a bit the water in case wondering look good enough to drink get some type of poisoning for drinking water rat pee and die drowning in pool of vomit and bile right the good looking water since water and face movement two watermark for good graphic aresound the gun sound amazingin the sense wwii weapon sounded like pop gun in comparison to modern gun the voice acting is really really good like really the music in the pacific theater level suck it actually suck so much overshadowing a very nice game it a faux pa comparable to using godsmack for pop warrior within i dunno sean murray is but dude you is the suckzors on the hand mr lost boy himelf cplthensgt roebuck is excellent and to be left behind by gary oldman a reznov who for of you who saw enemy at the gate should have been called koulikov but i guess they would have suedgameplay oooh ok the nitty gritty this game ha way moreumquirks than cod collectible and um mode and stuff so thats your tea in a cup goodly but this game not feel a tight a cod the sloppiness isnt so bad that it detracts gameplay but it is noticeable right from the start it doesnt help either that often than not there a variety of path to take not that the game is not linear it is just it up to you whether or not you want to take it up the trench or whether you want to slap the bullseye on your helmet and go the top but for the most part ahem yes this is cod on wwii wheel to though thats not bad is it worth shelling over at first i thought no but there the issue of different game modessingle campaign solo this game suffers greatly from uneven level design let me specifythe game unlike cod doesnt follow a cohesive storylinethe problem lie in the fact that youre not pursuing two terrorist who have one common endgameno youre fighting the whole axisso you take that from macro to micro it suffers and the level seem tacked on truth be told every level feel separate from the next in retrospective make cod sp truly shine it seems like a great movie ww just seems like random wwii encounter put together i love wii so thats not a problem for me but it might be for you now the meat and potatoescompetitive mp well i wowed it is very much so like cod but you start complaining think it whats bad about that and ive been hearing is true power housing in this game is way more difficult a is campingbecause it easy to catch a camper sitting on arse from behind the level design were thought in a more organic way i think war ravaged building outlandish situation another very interesting byproduct of this a wwii is the weapon you might say huh well wwii shooter have wwii gun what doe that mean well by modernday gun standard a lot of the weapon used in wwii are underpowered a exception aside the weakness of wwii gun have been implemented in a way that it hinders you like it would in real life something that wasnt really present in cod because modern day gun are a progression of improvement in weaponry the mp for example is a powerhouse because heck it a frickin state of the art gun but for example take the beloved garand it powerful and it is precise and you have to have a happy trigger finger to have a good repeat on it and you have to take a frickin clip and it go ping when youre out and thats gon na be every shot shoot another example the bar ooooh chill well it slow going and the clip is a measly bullet shall talk about bolt action rifle shoot bolt shoot bolt five bullet and megalong reload oh no also the grenade werent a powerful a they are now and tater masher are sort of a joke unless you have the aim of william tell so i think for now since im still starting the gameplay ha been kept level the gun a well now the pleasant surprisecoop mp well i played with a friend and wow we kept dying and coming back laughing talk about team work being important it similar to r coop but are no class so every character is on the level and every player take care of buddy with careful planning but i got ta say and hey we played about two level friend and i but this mode made me say well im glad i didnt wait it got to really i mean this mode of play overshadows the sp greatly for the single fact that it the same thing just multiplayerso issue taken account i still dont know if we could cut treyarch some slack or notthey say plagiarism is the best form of compliment these guy might not be the best developer around and they are not far from being the worst from what i hear i never played cod but they sure know how to identify the feature that make a good game and putting togetheras a sidenote the first level you play a a soviet is a dead ringer for the initial scene from enemy at the gate which had been somewhat depicted in cod but it didnt matter much to me it wa incredibly fun old timey sniping wa good timey snipingbtw the flamethrower let just say ive rekindled my pyromania at least in a safe way pun totally

2666,A20FR2NG18QAKX,B002I096AA,alright time come the d finally upon u ive mine since launch day actually got early who counting and had time feel the system first glance one might ask buy a d a d came out last year come nintendo and right to extent the dawning the dsi xl rather recent it really cant considered a legitimate new hardware hell id even consider the dsi originally to be much of a new innovative thingclever marketing it may be nintendo didnt just rehash a system time of you saying you the effect honestly it go either way the d not make the system for though it may be the title standing point it wa not the reason whatsoever i purchased this new hardware i personally hate d and think an awful gimmick and while the d effect is cool and somewhat a nice example of the technology it simply not enough to validate purchasing the system especially due to the incredible headache it ha provoked on to me a good minute of menu sorting what else is to say well the overall make of the game is rather nice it seems solid well built and everything just feel like it work rather well wireless switch the power switch wa a collapsing stylus a nice touch sensitive screen it is worthy of the you spend the button click a you press not to the point where resistance will stop you punching fast enough but to the point where you know are working in addition and probably favorite new thing have a little thumbstick lovely it make moving around in certain game feel so much natural and it really help fighting game so far my gripe with the hardware is that they glossed it gloss is my ultimate foe it pick fingerprint rather easily to the point where i dont like playing it unless i washed my hand first and i a lot a touch screen phone and the second problem is turning it now itd be nice to hold the power button a sec and turn it off but this thing seems to take a while to power it sort of worry me i also have had a time where in the midst of a game it gave me an unknown error and forced me to hard restart the system i hope this is patched the battery life is shallow but one really limit how much they play outside home it come with a little charging base seems poorly constructed but doe it job damn well every night i drop it in the cradle and go to sleep next day i take it with me get my daily coin for walking with it and sometimes play a few game im sitting idly i enjoying the hardware and the pedometer really give you that extra incentive to take it with you wherever you go not to mention streetpass though ive sadly come in contact with nobody that have another d since i bought this thing haha hopefully otakon will change that this year dthere are camera ability just a the dsi originally had with game like faceraiders and the ar card function there neat little minigames and application you can use to get people around you going wow though i wouldnt consider it a real selling point the photo often show up rather blurry and pixelated though i dont think this system is an intended digital cameraso dollar not bad at all consider the previous price for handhelds and i think it a valid price for something that pack a punch i see serious potential in this system the lineup at the present moment is incredibly dull and shallow but i am hoping and praying and am anticipating that nintendo wont let this system fail having picked up game like street fighter ghost recon dead alive splinter cell and more it would seem nintendo is having problem finding beefy franchise to boast their new technology withoverall i am to talk about the system itself and a of right now sure the game lineup suck but the system ha the ability and already is showing great example of the power it hold and the potential waiting to be unlocked a cheap price a great entertainment source in the work and an overall conversation starter among group everywhere yes i think the d is here to stay for a bit,4,3,7,5,2011,4,11,2,2011-04-11

2675,AWGPEXO9M8R7Q,B003O6JIVE,let start saying actually liked original ff xiii i know lot people didnt i understand xiii strength also had it weakness the point i honestly surprised announced a sequelbut many problem a xiii had xiii address problem and came a the game that the original xiii beenits longer a corridor crawl area objective and a map leading to that objective youre shoehorned going where the game want you to go you have room to explore and side quest the linearity and lack of town much improved thisthe battle a mixed bag it a little different engaging enemy it a mix creature pop up the world map having a limited time to either engage flee the actual battle are similar enough to xiii that you could go straight the old game to one and feel right homeboss battle however include a new feature thats pretty much the quick time event that you see game however it give you ample warning that an event is coming up the time to react is very generous and it doesnt end in a game you mess up you simply dont end the battle a well a you could may mean missing on enemy drop or a slight change in story lineim rather split on this a far a quick time event go xiii this very well but im not used to having this kind of play mechanic in a jrpg it could a take it or leave itso here xiii right they refined the battle system added town and opened up the exploration this doe everything xiii tried to do better this is the game xiii wa trying to be in this way it is a very good game and well worth your moneyheres what xiii did wrong it is a very short game looking at the calendar it wa released on jan i just beat it yesterday eight day i beat this game in eight day i have never beaten an rpg let alone a final fantasy game in eight day sure there still plenty of side quest to do there plenty of content that offset the shortness of the main quest but the main quest is the real meat ofand the main reason to buya jrpg it should never be so short particularly a final fantasy gamealso the ending yes do let me rant awhile without spoiling much it a bit of a downer ending that i can handle crisis core had a downer ending tomb raider last revelation had a downer ending hamlet had a downer ending i can handle downer endingswhat i dont like are three little word to be continued when you spend premium price on a game you shouldnt have to proceed to be nickel and dimed by downloadable content to get the real ending actually i wouldnt even be so harsh to be continued a long a the game had a selfcontained ending an ending that would make you say yeah there to see i may get the next part to see it resolve but i feel satisfied with this if this is i see of this story line i still feel like i had a complete story and therefore a complete experiencebut thats not what they do the ending leaf everything in a very bad very unresolved way they let you know that if you want kind of resolution youre going to have to pay more and beyond the not so cheap sticker pricenow dont get me wrong i think downloadable content ha it place an outfit a special weapon new character new map but to make a precedent where you have to download the actual ending to the game above and beyond the sticker price is the start of a slippery slope of not having to have an entire game on a rather expensive disk dolling out the rest of the game in an undetermined number of expansion that nickel and dime the player already paid to be able to play and finish the gameso where doe that leave this review doe the good outweigh the badunfortunately yes the good doe outweigh the bad like i said at the beginning of this review i liked the original xiii this doe everything better it what xiii should have i may or may not go the dlc that finish out the game though ill be a sucker if i do but the bottom line is that this game is fun it ha an emotional impact with the story you come to care about the character it a heck of a journeyi would give this game five star even given the shortness of the main quest the ending and having to go to dlc in order to finish the game however is going to cost it a starits a dangerous precedent of not having an entire game on the disk and forcing the player into downloading more dlc in order to have a complete experience video game are an expensive hobby enough without nickel and dimed just to get a complete gamei would say three and a half star amazon doesnt deal in half star since everything else about the game is so good ill be generous and say four star,4,3,10,9,2012,2,9,1,2012-02-09

2777,AWT53A209LVQ0,B0002CHJA0,havent completed singleplayer campaign ghost recon i thought i would go ahead offer impression nonetheless first the tom clancy game my favorite xbox franchise halo and i loved the first ghost recon and the island thunder expansion pack despite flaw i first heard ghost recon i pretty excited about seeing the final product ive played the actual game for i cant help but agree reviewer say that although ghost recon may well a good game really isnt ghost recon despite their occasionally rough graphic and overcomplicated control i ultimately think that gr and grit unique and enjoyable gr i must give ubisoft credit for willing go a new direction with the sequel to one their popular game instead of simply tweaking the graphic a little and adding a new feature here ea anyone didnt like the fixed first person perspective of the first game well now switch first person and the shoulder view thought the menu were confusing now theyve simplified and the selection of weapon streamlined thought the command system for managing squad wa complicated now you one squad to worry about and the command system more closely resembles rainbow than the original ghost recon in fact the whole game seems much closer to rainbow than the first ghost recon and therein lie much of the problem i think yes gr wa a little complicated but you master it you a wealth of option available to you in term of strategy and tactic gr much more like a typical runandgun shooter in you have a squad who back you in other word rainbow one squad isnt too much of a problem for i often went with one in the first game to simplify matter but the ability to switch between character is sorely lacking in the first game you could be the sniper whenever that wa necessary or switch to the guy with an automatic weapon whenever you needed to hose a building full of enemy but now you simply command your squadmates to thing for you ubisoft also apparently eliminated indoor environment is understandable given that the squad would often get stuck in doorway and whenever you went inside a building in the first game but i think could have just fixed that problem instead of simply getting rid of wa an interesting element of gameplay the ai is also a little different the north korean seem more adept taking cover and protecting than the russian or cuban did in gr and grit but their heightened aggression come at a price in the first game the enemy basically patrolled a certain number of path which allowed you to observe and decide to best attack them at your leisure in gr they simply spawn when you reach certain point at the game and attack you en masse much of the stealth and strategy element that distinguished the first game and expansion pack are simply gone in it place you have a wellpolished and nicely executed military shooter that bear little resemblance to it predecessor and is best enjoyed without prior expectation,4,3,2,2,2005,1,13,1,2005-01-13

2783,A3HN7D7HEQGM1R,B001ASJISG,big fan prince of persia i liked sand of time thought goty nomination taking far i saw it a solid highly enjoyable experience but not aaa title others touted it asi skeptical of igns review of this new pop the reviewer a love affair the game the page of ign seemed like he wa too much love with the series in general give a truly unbiased review i also recently reading many revisionist take on this game saying it too short too easy too shallow bad combat overrated etc the usual thing the second guesser say a well received gamei picked a copy of the game and have beaten it and unlocked of the achievement the i have ever done in a game in depth experience given informed impression of the game is much this game right where it just grab hold you in the palm of hand time you may find annoyed frustrated even bored all in all this is an excellent game you experience but ubi soft had a particular type of gamer in mind designed this new prince of persialet me start with you should get this gamefor one the game is absolutely gorgeous a work of art i love the look of this game and it is nice to see a western developer create a style detailed and beautiful i cant stand the big eyed weird looking japanese style of artistic game and i hope other western devs follow ubi softs lead it is part cel shaded part conventional graphic reminds me of a movie us rotoscope animation the game world is like a painting in a museum and the main character have so much detail and care put design and every movement you cant help but take notice even when in an intense situation this is the type of game you stop playing for a bit and just look at the prince stand on a balcony of a massive tower overlooking a massive landscape is a sight to behold my dream game would a conan game which us ubi softs engine and frank frazettas art stylethe difficulty in this game is about the a sand of time and may even be a tick challenging you cant die in the game the ai character will always save you it is a bit lame but it is not much different using the time control in sand of time to rewind time to save yourself it is essentially the same concept i dont see why so hard on this game but give sand of time a pas also there are a ton of game which allow you to save anywhere at anytime creating checkpoint is that le cheap than not dying in this game there is also an achievement you get where the ai can not save you more than time there a little incentive for you to be more careful and there is another component to this game which involves collecting light cystals you beat certain area it can be pretty damn tough to get all of and offer a different kind of challengealot of game day are short too short prince of persia is not one of game though yes you beat it you may be done with it but it is like that with most single player game it took me well hour to beat this game now alot of my time had been spent gawking at the scenery but this isnt a game meant to be rushed you really have to stop once in a and soak it all inthe gameplay is good and the control are top notch this is an action platformer and a joy to play there are plenty of intense and epic moment to be had in this game you constantly be wondering else they have in store for you the gameplay is like sand of time but with a slightly faster pace and more intuitive controlsthe combat is pretty good this is not warrior within so there arent that many enemy to do battle with the focus is platforming and exploration what combat there is though is pretty fun a more polished version of sand of time where you can do some really cool stuff the gripe i have about the combat are the flash prompt which i will discus laterthe sound in this game is incredible the effect to the music it doesnt just sound good but it know the right time to kick in a well youll hear an earth shattering roar just when thing started to get nice and quiet or youll hear some epic movie like music just a you walk onto that balcony to check out the scenery like luke skywalker watching the tatooine sun set with a john williams score in the backgroundyes there are some flaw and ill mention them real quickthe prince can be annoying ubi soft ha an incredible art style and gorgeous game world they should have taken the character more seriously they went in a tongue in cheek direction but with the prince character they tried to make sarcastic and witty but he come across a a bad disney version of han solo or a poor man ash bruce campbell in evil dead movie it doe take away from the game quite a bit at first but eventually he will either grow on you or youll learn to tolerate himthe story is generic would have been nice to have a story that matched the scale of the game world but it is nothing too bad especially video game standard the ending i must say redeems the story completely and leaf you gaping at your screen exceptionalcollecting the light seed will seem tedious at first it to me but then i realized the real challenge in getting to some of these thing and how it add a new dimension to the gameplay i soon looked forward to collecting them but they will be tedious to othersthe game ha incredible platform element im talking some pretty intense stuff here but the platform puzzle aspect other than getting to some of the light seed is lacking one main reason for this is you can have your ai companion cast a spell which light up the path you need to take a glowing orb will show you the direction you press the button still getting through that path safely can be quite a challenge and when it come to finding a way to get to light seed youre on your own some tomb raider like puzzle would have been great and would have added much to the gameplaythe game world feel a little lonely not that many character you are basically trying to save an abandoned part of the world so it mostly just you and the ai companion along with the occasional enemy to battle would have been awesome if this game had a zelda like spin to it a minor gripethe boss are pretty impressive in the game but you dont have any real fear of dying from them youll be amazed what you live through the fight can be quite the spectacle a spectacle you are fully involved in but the battle also use what i will call flash prompt where the bad guy get close and enters an animation and you cant control your youre supposed to wait for the appropriate button to fash on the screen and if you hit it in time the prince will react and counter but if you miss it you get to watch him get beat on these flash prompt were a pain to me i felt detached from the experience they arent a huge portion of the battle experience thoughfinal thoughtsprince of persia wa designed with a more casual gamer in mind someone is not particularly seasoned in gaming but is interested in getting lost in a beautiful new world somneone who enjoys game but doe not have the time to sink endless hour into one and accomplish nothing the objective of the game are the same throughout beat a world which take around min or so and then collect the needed light seed it is the type of game best enjoyed when played in spurt a opposed to setting aside your whole weekend afternoon the longer you play it the more tedious the limited battle and light seed collecting becomes when you play it in spurt such a an hour or maybe two at a time then you will be presented with a gorgeous and fully detailed world lifted right out of the dream of your childhood and the page of a fairy tale the platforming and acrobatic move are a joy and collecting all the light seed in an area is a challenge but one that wont keep you up all night the gameplay is incredibly streamlined and there is a deliberate effort to avoid frustration a much a possible this is good for those who play it in spurt but possibly problematic for those who grind right through every game they get with the beautiful animation ubi soft is also flirting with some dangerous territory here where you feel you are watching the game more than playing the game still quite challenging but at time the platforming seems a little too automated a wellit is a beautiful elegant game which control perfectly and ooze high production value with it top notch presentation the game is in many way a work of art a visual and audio work of art story except for the end is rather bland and the gameplay highly streamlined the game doe hold your hand more than many would like but the critic of prince of persia are exaggerating quite a bit when it come to this game it is a well made product a work of art and can be ton of fun just play it in spurt and not with a must beat it mindset sit back and soak it all in youll be glad you didmy letter grade for prince of persia would be a b,4,3,0,0,2008,12,25,1,2008-12-25

2792,A3W3LP0RSWLJCS,B003O6G5TW,got lot mileage ofbattlefield bad company campaign pretty much a bust i wa still fun multiplayer mode a week ago wa time start bracing game it wa the fun id with fps since the original battlefield another game wasnt necessarily having an itchy trigger finger whether could work together with team to complete an objective battlefield continues that tradition of addicting teambased gameplay delivering one of the finest multiplayer mode ive ever playedbut it mad rush to dethrone the call of duty franchise the developer dice may pulled the trigger a bit early while still a game that hold high all others in the genre it weak at the kneescampaignas i said the campaign for bad company couldve better it wa pretty frantic at time but it wasnt long it started to feel repetitive you throw many enemy soldier a you want at the player but there substance no reason to even care if youre shot at somethings battlefield try to rectify this making the mission involving mostly action it not so much go kill though you a lot of that but more like go here guess whats gon na happen next there more variety in term of mission completed for an idea of i mean it kinda boil to this if youve played the modern warfare series well you godice have tried to capture that proverbial cod lightning in a bottle by delivering a campaign that feel like modern warfare if it tried to take itself way too seriously and that might be good or bad depending battlefield all the action but a startling lack of character that exude anything military protocol you know that you for the most part play a staff sergeant henry blackburn the solemn stonefaced u marine that you see in cutscenes mission you also know that blackburn wa attempting to stop a nuclear threat of kind before being placed interrogation by superior aside that the eyepopping action and the attention to detail there not much more to it than thatgranted all of the level look dazzling and unique from each other it obvious that a lot of work went the level design i cant tell you how many time i found holding the mission to take in the scenery it definitely one of the best if not the best looking game currently available the xbox for a game to look this good on sixyearold hardware dice must have magician working for themits definitely the best battlefield campaign that ive played unlike bc i wa rarely bored the action is intense there some interesting twist and turn and the visuals take everything up to a whole other level the main caveat being that it just nothing that hasnt been done before militarybased shooter involving a nuclear threat are in no short supply day add to that your typical launch day glitchesbugs questionable ai and lack of compelling character to care about and youve got a campaign that wont disappoint but at the time only raise the bar for it franchisethough it doe pull off a framed narrative with more competence than dragon age ill take excuse to rail that gamemultiplayera majority of bfs player will very likely forget that there a campaign disc and throw straight at the multiplayer almost that myself to be brief that multiplayer is good very good i wasnt sure how dice would improve on bad company nearflawless in opinion multiplayer mode but theyve certainly found a way a lot of the change are cosmetic the level are more citybased add a whole new element of strategy coming from bcs mostly rural settingthe destruction aspect is still there smaller one or two story building that take a little bit too much flak will eventually collapse and taller building under the same treatment will shed mound of debris onto the street exposing the inner floor and decimating any player unlucky enough to be standing on the wrong part of the sidewalk there wa some concern about whether or not the destruction wa toned down for bf but i dont believe it ha there just different form of destruction youre not going to see tower collapsing onto the street or anything but like in bc the level probably wont look very pretty by the time your game overthe vehicle are back with the notable addition of the fa super hornet enabling jet combat with it own set of weapon and countermeasure new to the series vehicle can now be disabled making it possible for ground troop to get the upper hand with some effort the class have also been tweaked a bit with assault now fulfilling the role of medic a well and the new support class being for ammo distribution and enemy suppression to top it all off there are many more option for customizing and finetuning your weapon and sidearm to suit your playstyle no colorful weapon skin or anything like that but i consider that a plus in this contextmovement ha been improved with the ability to vaultslide over obstacle and the reintroduction of being able to go prone at first i wa very much against this since i could envision half the map hiding away prone sniping until got bored doesnt mean that didnt happen but the lack of maneuverability you have make it difficult to defend you be discovered keep thing nice and balanced for nowthe current downside to the multiplayer is that it not quite stable it very clear that ea underestimated just how many people would be playing so lag and entire server going dark is a constant at this point i havent even been able to access all of the map yet it tough for to complain le than two day launch since this is usually the case for all game of this type but with the campaign being in the almost state it is now and the rest of the game being so heavily reliant on it online element you might have yourself a two disc game and nothing to dothis should be cleared up and stabilized within the next few week along with the battery of patch that are sure to come but if you like having the certainty of playing a you like waiting to pick this game up might be in your best interestas it stand ive played through the campaign and seen enough of the multiplayer to know that i wont be regretting this purchase i can nitpick about this aggravating online pas business the ai teammate that like to push me out of cover or how the only female character in the game is the only one doesnt talk but it wouldnt take away from the fact that ive been having the time of my life when the server permit it in my mind these nitpicks are what keep battlefield from achieving the absolute greatness that i thought it would on it first try but even so it still met my expectation and it been a great ride so farnow can all sit back and wait for the inevitable battlefield

2797,AXKOIBI3C9NT2,B0050SXLQC,knew exactly i would getting resident evil i waited game dropped amazon i actually intention ever playing couldnt believe the price i think even disappointing game worth bill long a are playablethis game is resident evil i know know that a thirdperson action shooter that take place the universe and utilizes the re character they really shouldve just created game a a totally different ip and put the resident evil trademark to pasture youre looking the classic re experience just give and go play the earlier game that experience is never coming backso it fare a action shooter in opinion not well i personally cant stand how close the camera follows character a heshe essentially take up half of the screen making it difficult to see enemy and obstacle are particularly in skinny hallway and small room and especially running with exception the environment are incredibly dark even with the brightness maxed out making it the difficult to see what youre supposed to be shooting given the outrageous scripted action sequence and active environment there not a lot of horror to be had and to navigate unnecessarily dark room is aggravating instead of scary and also led to some serious eyestrainthe aiming mechanic are clunky and it be difficult to hit moving enemy of are leading to a frustrating waste of ammo which is often surprisingly scarce for an action shooter this can be counteracted however utilizing a character melee attack which is almost too effective but it silly to play what is clearly a shooting game and go around throwing elbow all the time you can at least move aiming and thats a nice feature shooter however the movement is incredible slow and is not really useful in most situation your character also a nasty habit of automatically sticking up next to wall and form of standing cover when you get near them while aiming with this often happened suddenly and unexpectedly right in the middle of a huge firefight leading to frustrating battle with the controller to get my character the wall and back controlthe enemy you face this time around are of course zombie and a variety of strange increasingly bizarre mutated thing unfortunately the term zombie is used more for historical effect a the enemy in re are a far cry what most would consider zombie zombie shoot firearm including light machine gun and rocket launcher a well a carry shield and pop in and out of cover how jarringly stupid is that a i mentioned this is a flagrant reminder that this is not resident evil but just a call of dutystyle shooter with a very thin coat of traditional survival horror paint slapped on it give me a freaking break capcomas another slap in the face to survival horror your character now ha a constant companion human aithat join you this is of course entirely for the purpose of humanhuman coop gameplay but it make an already unscary game even le scary i never played with a human teammate i cant comment on that although i suspect it probably enjoyable but i can easily say that the friendly ai player is incredibly useless they cant seem to hit thing a foot in front of them most time and it not uncommon to see himher go running into and a room completely ignoring the enemy within to stop at the exit and wait at least theyre seemingly invincible and you dont have to keep reviving them and on no real surprising note coop event are inanely limited a always to pressing a button to open a door together or pressing a button to boost the other player up to a higher levelthe graphic are nice and pretty but thats about all company like capcom and squareenix are known for day the music and sound are fine but nothing to write home about and nothing memorable the voice acting is pretty decent but the dialogue is standard hokey farethe plot is not noteworty by any mean unless you happen to be obsessed with the re universe and it detail i followed along with all of the cutscenes and dialogue throughout the entire game and i remember very little of why i what i wa doing care move from point a to point b and shoot at bad guy until a really large bad guy show up and shoot at it eventually the game end ive done all of this many many time in other game in the last several yearsfortunately the cutscenes in re are not obnoxiously long or even painful to watch a in some other game but they still pop up time when you just want to play the game not watch it a in other modern game with cutscenes are many stretch during which you will sit through a cutscene only to regain control of your character so that you can walk a single hallway and into yet another cutscene sometimes rinse and repeat or twice more that this ha become somewhat of a staple of video game these day and is rapidly wearing out it welcome scripted action sequence and scene are plentiful but sadly very routine and lacking creativity a a helicopter suddenly showing up to blow up car in front of you or a zombie magically appearing in an apartment window and blowing up something in front of you with a rocket launcherthe length of the experience is a notable plus there are four campaign made up of chapter and a good number of them will take many hour to beat leading easily to a total playtime of hour if youre looking for a game that ha a high timemoney ratio then this is a good pick i dont like multiplayer addons and can not comment on aspect of this gameoverall to me the problem with this game is that is doe nothing new and nothing memorable ive played this game many time before under a variety of name and title and god know there are more to come i get why developer are morphing popular nonaction series into action series because they appeal to a broader audience and are more financially palatable to publisher and investor but i can still express my disappointment with this evolution in game design and i will still mourn the decline of memorable gameplay of many many year agoin my opinion from a pure gaming point of view i wasnt miserable while playing re but im very proud that i only paid for it a rental an extended weekend would have probably worked even better there just no reason to pay more than that for an action shooter experience that you can experience any other day of the week,3,3,2,2,2013,5,23,2,2013-05-23

2799,AT033BUEYOOKV,B000035XKL,spiderman otherwise known amazing spiderman v the kingpin sega genesismegadrive truly awesome superhero experience manages nail lot important character trait translating to gameplay the game work wonderfully itas spidermanpeter parker youre dropped a platforming action game the ability to climb wall web swing across the city skyline and shoot spidermans trademark web shooter while the combat certainly isnt a varied deep a something like maximum carnage the level design here is wonderful and make a lot of make the game great air vent to crawl wall to climb hidden powerups to collect a ton of fun traversing these levelswhat also help is spidermans ability to take photo these stage parker sell to the daily bugle to support superhero antic the money earns he spends it on the web fluid he need a spiderman is a great addition to the game a it done well it a lot deeper you initially imagine it photo become an essential part of this game and it absolutely character appropriate on a regular basis youll earn for taking photo of regular enemy and upwards of for photo of super villain which appropriately make up the end boss of these well designed varied stagescontrol is pitch perfect climbing wall web slinging around and generally being spiderman feel natural to the sega genesis the game a great job of making you feel like you whatever a spider can the web slinging web shooting and even the basic attack combat control are superior even to of the recent bit spiderman outing the web slinging feel extremely fluid especially compared to the game based on the animated series or even the glorious maximum carnagegraphically the game fare ok this is an early genesismegadrive game all some thing arent a detailed a would have liked to see a bit game of this type for the time this released the visuals are definitely serviceable there are great static cutscene image look a though ripped straight the comic and all of the character are immediately recognizablethe bos fight in this game require a fair bit of trial and error to complete while you may able to get with just beating down some of the boss and hoping they die you do for a lot of these encounter youll have to rely on a solid strategy it memorizing pattern and exploiting initially i hated some of these boss electro being the main offender however i played the game more and figured out to take these boss out i could get past of them with minimal troublethese bos fight and the beating youll initially take from them lead to the way health work in this game while there are health pickup found throughout some of the level arent nearly enough to fill health bar all the way youve taken a moderate amount of damage this is where peter parker apartment come into play the entire game is set on an ingame hour timer the timer move quite slowly far from realtime though mind you but when you return to parker apartment it speed up significantly this is returning to the apartment is used a a mean to regain lost health you take spidey back there let rest up for about an ingame hour about second in realtime then youre back the beginning of the level you left much like the photography mechanic this health system is also quite deep and work well considering the timer here made with great care it lenient enough to give you more than a couple of hour to spare yet when you die and have to continue youll lose hour on the clock granted there are unlimited continues a long a you still have time to spare but it almost always better to heal up at your apartment than to flat out die the extra ingame hour you save is worth itthe audio here isnt spectacular a lot of the music fare well enough though it nowhere near maximum carnage green jelly quality the sound effect for punch kick etc dont sound all wonderful either from an audio standpoint this is a passable game which is a shame a every aspect is perfect imo it make me wish this exact game were released later in the genesis lifecycle with better sound and visuals however there is a great sega cd version of this game that fix a lot of the issue i have a well a adding new mechanic to the gameplayall in all i would recommend either version the amazing spiderman v the kingpin get so many thing right about spiderman it easy to overlook the flaw a the poor implemented minibosses that being said i believe every bos fight is fun up to and including the kingpin and theyre all intense in way this can be a really short game but it definitely an easy one it not the hardest game ever or anything like that but it definitely a challenging enough experiencethis is a truly great game and honestly one of the best spiderman game ever made it get nearly everything down to a perfect character appropriate science and any spidey fan would be a disservice by passing this one up this isnt nostalgia talking either i didnt even get the chance to play this when i wa a kid i genuinely love this game a an adult though and think it surpasses even later spiderman game entry like i said the game is absolutely a great time it a great way to spend an afternoon and i cant stress enough how fan of spidey really not pas this one up it still worth a look to this day,5,3,0,0,2014,5,15,2,2014-05-15

2804,AOGRIMH5H12J,B001QXNBJM,finally finished campaign added the end original multiplayer review i good amount of gaming time franchise i already a big fan of cod i got bc i wa impressed with the lack of class customization and felt it not have much of a reply value i went back to cod mw a great game disappointed several way the turned damage made shootout short and unsatisfying team coordination made playing without friend frustrating select class combo made combat cheesy tac knife runner duel shotgun runner old javelin cheat i found frustrated fun and decided to stop playing mw my brother convinced to try the bc demo and day i wa hookedi wanted to point a highlight that separate game from mw and bcthe speed of the game is up to large map and lot of cover facilitate numerous playing style a lot of area that are le traveled and allow flanking maneuver sniper spot you are able to wait in cover for extended period of time allowing for more tactical movement or for the stealthy approach ive already chastised for camping something severely looked upon in mw the rule are different in bc establishing a defense and eliminating a threat no matter are is the name of the game thing like establishing a kill zone or stealing vehicle disturb the enemy operation tempo is a viable tactic for victorykits are better balanced and allow customization assault is the backbone for antiinfantry operation rifle are good balance of power accuracy and rate of fire rof they are able to carry a grenade smoke or dart shotgun launcher they are the source of ammo the battlefield engineer play several role they can repair vehicle well a can carry rocketsmines to destroy primary weapon is a silenced smg which is deadly for cqb and flanking maneuver the medic is the only source of healing and can revive downed teammate they carry a lmg and can a effective attacker or support gunner the sniper can be effective mean of disturbing the enemy distant they can specialize in a boltaction for longrange kill or a semiauto for more tactical ops they can be demolition expert with c or the mortar strike with the spotter scope they can provide quick recon data although customization is not even close to mw some option allow you to put different sight on weapon decide you want to carry more ammo have more accuracy or damage they now also allow class to carry a small selection of shotgun smg and riflesvehicles can play a major part in your victory but are only a good a the support a dedicated engineer with infantry support can ensure a tank can last the fight on the end a coordinated rocket attack or cmine strike could halt a tank advance depending on the map you can have a medium scale tank battle andor chopper supportdestruction is what set this game apart from every other fps youve played the battlefield is ever changing and you must adapt or die the game allows you to destroy almost everything and you find that good cover is a temporary convenience destruction will continually present you opportunity or obstacle that will sway the outcome of battle a house that made for a good observation point maybe completely gone next time you go to it or a simple hole in a wall may become a vital sniper positionsound quality is the finest of any other fps ive played you will hear the echoing gunfire indoors and the explosion will rattle your eardrum crouching is an important tool when you moving in the snow to walking up the stair a you sneak up on your enemy lastly you will hear the crackle of every sniper shot that fly pas your domejrod thanks for the addition the damage is another aspect that i think is done well in this game with a good eye and a disciplined trigger finger you can drop enemy at range fairly easy with a nonscoped weapon at the time you can play the rush still take some good hit and continue to contribute to the attack if youre one of guy that complain that taking many bullet to kill the game offer hardcore modeneed to finish this with a few conscustomization improved from the first game but still in the shadow of mw seriessquads are limited to people and may hamper large partiesservers problem can be frustrating it may take several minute or you may need to wait a finally joining a match hopefully this is fixed in the longrunto add to the server problem i have kicked from the game and it ha froze on me timesthis is a longer review than i wanted but if i missed anything or need more data please add it in the comment if youre new to mwbc please read the indepth review of both game and ignore the star spam if you think you want an arena type shooter and want something fast paced and always in the thick of heavy gunfire mw way be your game if you want something that reward on cooperation a well a kill ha vehicle combat and destructible environment look no furtherupdate i finshed the campaign on normal and it wa not very long hour it comprises of level which very entertaining although the backbone of the campaign comprised of close to medium range gunfight it ensured that level did not get too repeditive you get the whole battlefield experience from run gun to tank battle the game will allow you to be behind the steering wheel of several vehicle the level design is fairly linear but overall combat reminded me a little of fry cry in several part you will be able to see your objective comprised of a compound or village although there is only one way to get to the objective you are free to flank and maneuver in it even linear scenario have house and other cover that allow to get the advantage on the enemy one thing i really liked is collectable weapon now serve a purpose at checkpoint there are supply point that allow you to swap for any two weapon that you have pickedup in the game this allows you to adapt to the current scenario or to your specific playing style it is important a you play that you check weapon cache and weapon that were carried your enemy another sidequest are destroying mcom station the game will tell you many there are on a map but it is up to you to explore the level to find them all other than great combat bad company come back with fresh and funny material in this round it feel little more natural finding the right time to make you laugh instead of throwing you oneliners every other minute the last thing i wanted to cover is difficultly and first play on normal wa right even on normal it wa not an easy walk and remaining out of cover for second ended in a quick death enemy fire will cause you to take cover and shift your position a they advance and flank like multiplayer destruction will play a significant role on how you fight ive my cover blown up several time and i even had a house collapse on me overall it wa a great ride but a short one for those are looking for a single player only i would suggest something with a little more depth since you can beat this in a day,4,3,7,3,2010,3,8,1,2010-03-08

2806,ASWBVMZAGFKXW,B00002STXN,game excellent way put remember playing it first time year ago yeah is long time i thought it the greatest thing ever the graphic supurb and even this day look beautiful though they dont stand to p graphicsit really doesnt matter oldskool game im a graphic kind guy and never wa it doesnt affect you really high tech graphic and havent played this i doubt you like it dont get me wrong game with high tech graphic are good but this game along with many others snes proove that graphic dont make any game but i dont play or a playstation so thats just i see it view on videogames are rather conservative if you are still and havent played this game i doubt you will like it though it doesnt appeal to younger payer any more due to old school design that kid tend not to appreciate these day but that doesnt mean kid wont like it i just think people played it the early are mainly the one who will enjoy it nowdays unless youre a zelda fanatic but havent played this one yet or if you like older game but havent gotten around to getting this one yet the music on this game is also very good although the dungeon music get very tedius and annoying it not that bad the world music is classic though and you play it enough it will ringing in ear gameplay also doesnt get much better you get a whole arsenal of item much more any zelda yet this game is basically the game that set the standard for other adventure game sometimes even rpgs another thing you might like about this game is that it is not way time consuming if you have a life to attend to you can so keeping up with the game a well even though i like really long game this game is short in a good way but the first time you play it it will probably take more than hour to beat least if you get all the heart container it will take even more isnt a lot of text in this game either there talking sequence but they usually end pretty quickall in all this game is classic and if you havent played itthats your mistake playing this game and hearing it music after year really brings back great childhood memory even to this day this game look better to me than new game it just that aura i highly recommend this to any one into adventure game or rpgs that ha a taste for the classic or anyone who like snes or ne game,5,3,1,1,2003,12,31,1,2003-12-31

2828,A24O6U575872K1,B001SGZL2W,dont typically review anything already copious review game unique i bored work i felt need review rrdthis game ha nice little introscene which reveals the setting cool and set the tone nicely a game which feel like a classic western movie starring clint eastwoodin term game play the two game i immediately reminded of oblivion and gta but let make this clear right this is two game a really unique experiencei never played red dead revolver but i played gun for the p and this game is kind of like that but a million time betterits like gta way overt others like the wanted level thing but it not really a sandbox game at it open world i suppose in that there a big map and ride around horse but a mission many of which streamlessly lead you realize this is a great single player story that ha arranged so that you a little bit of choice which and you the mission deal something more pertinent like shooting a cougar in the face on your way to towni know that gta is similar to i described but thats it hard to quantify the experience in rdr but suffice to say in gta you can get completely distracted with hey whats that thing or i want that car or countless racing challenge or play cop after stealing a cop car and a result neglect the main story which feel somewhat disjointed a you haphazardly beat one mission or another well rdr is not like thatyeah you can steal horse you want to and you can play bounty hunter and side mission but overall it feel like it part of the narrative not a distraction and the main mission play together really well and actually succeed in feeling like the event in the order for which you choose to play could work a the exact plot to a classic but really long cowboy movie like used to make none of this jonah hex crap wait two week to know what i am talking aboutin term of the oblivion likeness maybe it the horse which you can ride the country side looking for happening or maybe it the whole man on a missionbut do this thing for me first and maybe i help you but i just got the vibe hour in and i forgotten all oblivion first and this might obvious this is a not an rpg well maybe jrpg standard har har har but seriously dialogue option talking to stranger consists of tipping your hat and making some generic greeting but thats because this game ha a story and the main character ha an actual identity and it a pleasure to watch it unfoldas i mentioned in the gtacomparison section the story flow really well and keep you hooked however the result of this is unlike game like oblivion or more obviously the wonderful infamous where your every action seems to change the world around you not the case in rdrthe ability to choose your mission selection mean that you might be at a ranch where everyone wa slaughtered and then an hour later youll be at the ranch everyone is alive and well there not a whole lot of permanence in your action other then the story narrative advancedin short the setting is not a fluid organic thing similar to other game which are driven by a tight story beginning cinematic to end cinematic the difference is that this game creates an illusion of openness and the illusion is great the ability to ride your horse anywhere you want when you want to make you feel like you this character even though ha been created for you by rockstar it help that and everyone else character is fantasticnone of this is a criticism not exactly anyway well get to that either i have enjoyed gtas but never finished one im the poster child for add and it just much work for me to get through the whole thing i do side stuff i forget what the hell is even going on in the story then i play a new game ill end getting plenty of hour of it but never finishoblivion never finished i got too obsessed with trying to play a perfect game join every group do every quest lot of hour to be exact but still not finishedi will finish rdr and keep playing for those that say it short compared to gta well it long compared to gow and no one complained there because it wa a great experience same thing i am really excited to beat this game because the story is so good where the story in most gta game is moderately amusing a a satire but get oldhowever it a review fun overall well the gameplay is defiantly fun but there are some missed opportunity the wanted system work but it could have been so much better it similar to gta but where a in gta wanted level equated to highspeed chase racing your stolen car through oncoming traffic narrowly avoid car wreck or not and a fantastic explosion in rdr it just riding your horse through the desert make sense but not excitingthen you have a bounty which you precede to pay no biggie it a barebones game mechanic that get the job done but something a little more complex where picture of you went up around town and if they didnt catch you they couldnt confirm it wa you but some guy that look like you and the sheriff try harder to catch you red handed etc but ala not the case overall this system make an otherwise more realistic game have a bit of an arcade feel at timesthis complaint well call it that for lack of a better word is indicative the one thing plaguing the singleplayer that opportunity for action to really effect anything other your fame or honor bar maybe if when you saved a guy life that guy had a name etc and he would buy you a drink every time you went to the saloon and he wa there just a thought but instead everyone is not a main character is pretty facelessthe multiplayer is pretty weak i have a hard time penalizing game because of a subpar multiplayer when the singleplayer is spot on but in this case it really feel like a shame a le ambitious multiplayer maybe a smaller world that kept the player closer together with more to do then shoot each other or horde of random mexican would have been really cool it a lark for a bit you start with a mule and look like a homeless person and level up but there not much to it and it get boring fastso overall out of on fun lot and lot of fun to play i dont want to put it but it not a perfect experiencenow where i traditionally bump up the overall to a is when the polish really wow ala this game can be glitchy it hasnt gone to the point of cumbersome for me yet but if they didnt have checkpoint in the middle of mission i would have lost it by now i can not tell you how often i fail a mission due to glitch everything will go fine and wham failed you abandoned soandso when i wa right next to or you fail because you didnt do something right i can get more specific because i dont want to spoil anything but then do it the exact same way and it go off without a hitchthen the game get hungup sometimes thank god for autosave or this game might be unplayable due to glitch overall thanks to the aforementioned safety net it doesnt amount to more than a minor annoyance but it is frustrating when you stats arent accurate due to it and it can interrupt the overall experiencealso riding horse is tough at first do a favor open up the option and change horse control from relative to horse to relative to camera what were they thinking with that one also they dont do a great job explaining the whole horse stamen thing or dead eye and how it work the manual is almost worthless it look nice but it page long and not that full of info but high it full color rightheres a couple quick tip the blue bar in the left is your horse stamen yeah watch that much easier now huh oh that read bar thats your deadeye meter not repeat not your life got it to activate deadeye aim then click r this is essentialon this topic some of the control can be cumbersome it seems to hard to me to switch weapon which includes your lasso and ride a horse and keep on target how many finger do they think i have but i couldnt really tell you how to make it better there a lot of stuff to do sometimes but little thing would be nice like a map button so i didnt have to go thought the menu and some people dont like being forced to use l and r to fire i like it but thats personal i can see the irritation of no customizationi mean in reality it would be pretty hard to switch gun and ride a horse chasing someone and i have always been an advocate if the task is hard dont fault the game for making it feel hardand this game is not easy i often found the mission in gta to be boring unless they involved a car in some fashion the shooting mechanic have always been weak gta lockon target and just shoot the guy a bunch of time gta had some rudimentary coversystem but the whole thing wa pretty awfulrdr is fun and hard the single player isnt terribly difficult to get through but it remains challenging enough to be enjoyable all the way through but a lot of the random side stuff is actually hard youll kill the bad guy in the end but were you fast enough to save the person most of the time not dont worry youll get like a more chance to do better and it will be fun each and every time becasue it hard otherwise it would be like assassin creed really this againand where the car in gta drove like dump truck on a hockey rink the horse ride beautifully in this game just watch how they run for one thing and youll be amazed they get snagged on thing sometimes and they insist on jumping over anything if your moving at all even if your just trying to slow them down and get off but after a bit youll get the hang of itso this review turned out to be a lot longer than anticipated but i had a lot of fun writing it and i wanted to share thought with people who were like me asking everyone like this game some nutcase hate it but will i get hooked or will i get bored and lose interesti got hooked and hopefully if youre on the fence review helped if just a

2840,A1CLUR3JCYO0TQ,B002I0JAVK,playing regret i never got chance play the first one well fun far it the gem the review site said it is technically open world game confined within the boundary arkham city this work well the story it allows the developer extended liberty the villain are all working with inside the city and they are all worked fairly well despite the focus primarily the joker the story isnt really that hard to follow but i found losing interest sometimes because of all the different character are it also one of game you take two step back and one step forward every plot point task to go find freeze turn first running into the penguin ha actually captured freeze fighting all the penguin bad guy and finding freeze but then freeze cant help you you freeze a favor after you help freeze who help you then try to kill you another villain pop and you have to go chase batman also appears nonchalant running into various enemy however this keep thing fresh despite disjointed feel you run into robin killer croc and rescue vicki vale a helicopter crash sometimes i wish there dynamic in these interaction robin is there almost a lip service to the character you have the dlc you play a but is not a big part of the storythe game also suffers sometimes from i like to call random good guy appearance to save the situation mode you know where you are in trouble and then someone show up screen to save you i see it a a failure to take a risk with the character and it something have all seen way many time however the game have different ending based on a choice you can make a catwoman to either save batman not save batman it kind of interesting and a nice change of pace to give the player the option to choose a plot pointeverything the game you heard wa great is in factgreat so i wont spend too much time on them the gameplay is solid fighting mechanic are fun grappling and gliding around is fluid and look cool the gadget are cool a well a actually serving a purpose in the game you really feel like batman the game will often just leave you alone with idea of really where to go next thinking like batman will often get you of the situationthere are two thing i didnt like the environment is too dreary it not fun to explore like in other open world game you do a lot of backtracking but it difficult to recognize place the color palette is all grey black and dirty brown everything is crusted i think they went a little too far with the destruction of arkham i know it like that because of what is going on but i would prefer sacrificing of that for some color this also make the game graphically difficult to judge i dont think it graphically a good a red dead redemption environment or character model but it hard to judge the environment because everything is so downtrodden and the broken building start to look the inside and there is a certain part of the fighting system i dont like you have to beat up an enemy severely until you knock them out because batman dosnt kill people however he ha no problem breaking limb and landing punch that would probably cause brain damage anyway often they will lie on the ground unconscious but still able to get up you have to do a ground slam to finish them off imagine playing uncharted but then the guy you punch just lay there for awhile and then get back up the game compensates eventually letting you level up to perform critical strike critical strike are basically finishing move so you can string together a many a possible landing knock out blow however you can do this after a time combo where you then have to press x immediately after you finish one move and the next one this is actually more difficult it sound at later point in the game you will be surrounded by more bad guy if you button mash you almost do anyway because there are so many you will miss the critical strike thus you will be knocking guy out but they will get up and keep fighting you in the meantime you are being attacked by other guy the guy you just knocked out then come to fight you and you have to keep punching him some more until he finished i wish they would have just let you knock guy out after the first series of punchesbut if these issue do not bother you then the game is basically a ten a far a ten go,4,3,1,0,2012,3,11,1,2012-03-11

2876,A137Y8DXKXIEJ,B00503E9FY,give one star didnt fix problem modern warfare part two hadapparantly they assumed mw perfect they added extra and called it part think mw wa perfect this game seem perfect to you that casebuy itotherwiseif you didnt think it wa perfect read onthis review multiplayer and survival mode p the campaign mode i never plaything they didnt fix and may never fix and dont care fixing obviouslyspawn camping is still possible and easy a evernothing like dying within second becausepeople know you will spawn they obviously dont care cant change spawning worksit may a bug sometimes people will spawn right beside you or behind the spawn point right you spawnand kill you behind you already in a corneryou will often be spawned gunfire and explosion too and be killed instantly after spawningwhat they needed to wa get rid of spawn point and set spawn point where you spawn but rather make the spawnoccur in any random area that is clear of enermiesthe place you spawn never repeat but it sure but they dont care about that but thats a huge issueholding the square button still doe almost everything than shoot old problem nothing new except you have even stuff topick and move around use the square button to do just about everythingso if you next to alot of equipment or crate or whatever you will have no way to distinguish this or that and probablyreload when you dont want to and get killed if you want to move something when you have two thing nearby like a crate youwill not be able toby the time somebody come along and kill youapparantly they dont know the p lot of other button they could usebesides holding down the square buttonstill no way to customize your button eitherkillstreaks dont stack up for example if you get a care package and die then spawn and earn another care packagebefore you use the first one you wont have carepackages now you will still have oneif you earn two stealth bomber without using one you still only have onevery dum could be a bug but a doubt iti thinkits intentional that waymaps there not nearly enough map you end up playing the same map and over til you want to scream the map seemthe same except for one or two all are just boring city block imho i played the game for two day and im already sick of the mapsnone of the map really have any kind of a theme like black ops doe like black ops ha a golf course or missle launch site etcintermissions same a the game still always make you wait a full long second in between game even when everyone is ready to playits so dumb because if you need intermission you can just leave the lobby and give one to they dont realize how dumb theirintermission system is i dont know so usually if you dont want to wait you end up quiting intermission to find another game ready to goand end up joining the game right a about to end so you just cant winserver issue and lagwhich brings to other issue the game will try to put you in a game in progress often time and load it up for like i dunno forever and thencome back and say lost connection to host is never a way to abort joining a game there is no manual overrideso if it taking forever and you know it going to error outsome server error you still cant do anything about it except wait which is really dumbmy nat is moderate or open on every other fps i own including black ops but on this game the nat type is always strictit tell you to go to for help all that doe it give you a link to router company websitesit doesnt ever tell you anything about opening certain port on your router you have to bypass your router to get anopen nat and even then there is still lag lag ruin this kind of gamewhen you play you often get a lot of lag and the game is often so dumb it often wont even try to migrate the hostwhen it obviously need too since you have obvious lag other timesit keep migrating the host like constantly maybe or time it finally get it right other time the game will be over but before you can get the score to displayit stop and say migrating host and make you wait just to be free to quit and find another lobby to joinit doesnt seem to matter about your connection either because i bypassed router to get an open nat and i still lagits something else probably ha alot to do is actually hosting the game of the time i had type of lagthis bug existed before in mw too it like using the same exact engine a mw the bug is alot of time but notconsistantly just alot of time you will be low on ammo go to reload and it will show your dude reloading andwhen is done you still have not reloadedand you need to reload yet in order to actually reloadprosthey added alot of killstreak award though only a few are coolthey let you change killstreaks per loadoutthey let you choose when to use which killstreak award it doesnt have to be use last oneacheived first anymoreit depends on which killstreak it is some do require you to use it last one firstsurvival modeaside from it player max which is pretty lameit take a long time to find a player to play withcuz many will just quit then there a stupid built in second intermission when you do a if itdidnt take long enough to find a player now it force you to wait longer how dumb is thatall the enemy show up on the minimap which also make it too easy sometimesit let you call in an ai squad to help you fight the ai which is dumbbecause why would you want ai ally to help you killother ai enemy and if your teammate call in you cant prevent it it like letting the computer play if you are playingits because you want to shoot at thing not watch the ai troop shoot other ai troop wowif there any lag for second it will stop the game and wont let you continue on solo eitherif your teammate suck and keep dying you must keep reviving or else you lose you cant just finish the roundby yourself like you can in black ops zombiesback to multiplayerdoesnt stop to balance team on team match like when it people v people for instance it just keep going like thatlamestill b miracle kill from them you shoot them plus claymore them and they survive and run away or shoot you twice and kill you insteadstill appears to be a miss but count it a a hit especilly with snipersflashbangs still burn your eye instead of just turning screen black or something trying to be too realistic in annoying waysstill wont just let you spectate without kicking you outchanged from claymore at one time to only one like blak ops whyall knife weapon still too strongonly one setting for sound instead of different type of sound like black ops hasadditional issuescan see thru wall sometimes glitchysome cover provides no protection at all some weak cover like glass that never breaksprovides way too much protectionthey kill with one or two shot after taking huge damage and no shield could possibly be obtained yetwhen it recovers from host mirgration you can lose effect and mess up gamedoesnt count kill toward streak sometimes especially if it happens rite before you dieprone still can get stuk way too easily and you cant turn a if your virtual body ha no joint in itsometimes you get completely stuck on pixel of thing like crane forklift random obstacle etccant jump on top of almost anything depsite it being lowgun still auto change when it get empty so if you try to change gun manually you end up with the same empty gun againjavelin appears huger than a man on screenblocks view etcjavelin only weapon that doesnt change to full gun when empty sometimes wowjavelin will often hit the ceiling and kill u but not themno mute all still so if you want to mute people you have to do it one at a time constantlythe speaker icon when people yap is in bad place it annnoying seeing speaker icon come up on your screenwhen you try to mute people it unmutes other people at the same time must be a glitchbugone of the dumbest thing in the game you can lay down and walk into firewow doe that fact alone just sum up how lame this game isyou can crawl thru dead body and you have to because they dont disapear fast enoughno access to all map unless you play team game really dumb ideathe map are all boring and lack any theme have few room to even to go intooverall black ops is a much better game and zombie is way better than survival mode the best thing about survival mode is you can get sentry gunsi wish zombie had sentry gun in it hahai hope you appreciate the time i took to write you this review so click yes it wa helpful somewherei know there are ton of other review though but mine is probably the most

2893,A3Q5QOWMVPTAN2,B000GPXS94,disappointing fun pack sims lineup finally addition thats worth the name implies expansion pet sims dog small large cat bird womrats basically guinea pig a lot fun interaction run the sims pet the detailspros pet about enough said there a with the people sims pet sims are well portrayed the movement and behavior are very realistic just have a people sim play with a cat with a teaser toy and youll see mean creating a pet is a easy a creating a people sim can modify their feature give various colored collers etc with little effort i able to create a cat look and behaves very much like real life cat createapet also ha ability to create a breed dont find the breed you want make one there is one exception noted the con section though werewolf dont get friendly with that wolf that visit your lotunless your people sim is a knowledge sim all seem to want to become a werewolf for some reason the matchmaker nightlife sell cure for lycanthropy youre unfortunate though hmmsims alien university added zombie nightlife added vampire open for business added robot and now have werewolf make wonder what the upcoming season expansion add pet can have job that add a little income to the family a well service pet security pet and show pet are in high demand just ready to teach them trick that they can get promotion some nice new object floor tile and wallpaper of it is pet themed a be expected are actually useful much of what is in the fun pack new tool the hammer tool make remodeling so much nicer if you want to make a room bigger add some new wall outside of a current room use the hammer tool to get rid of the one wall thats blocking the new addition from the old much nicer than to live with all of the previous wall also the wall you remove are assigned a value and then that much is added back to your fund much like selling old object to replace with new remodeling isnt near a expensive a it used to be either leveling tool another new tool allows you with one click to level an entire lot to the level of the sidewalk you used to have to drag the cursor the whole lot and you had to exclude the boundary square to level it and even then there wa guarantee that it would be even with the sidewalk this new tool make it much more simple and quick you can still use the old leveling tool if you want variable terrain though unlockable goody i can understand someone wanting everything available the beginning but unlockable content add a little reward for accomplishing certain milestone this encourages more play like we really need more incentive to play this game skunk some might consider this a con watch for stinky skunk will visit your lot sooner or later what happens if stinky skunk doesnt like your pet welllets just say youd better have a people sim prepared to give your pet a bath and fastcons the create a petbreed utility though great for some reason doesnt allow you to modify a dog leg length of this creating a believable dachshund wiener dog or corgi is a yet impossible im a huge dachshund fan dont dislike them either but i like corgi so that wa disappointing bug for some reason some people sims have their want disappear having another controllable sim ask them what they want is one way around this but a pain you just need one more want satisfied to put the sim in gold status but you dont know what they want thats a new bug that ive noticed with sims pet many of the bug from previous sims expansion are still there a well ea know what a patch is would have liked to have seen a new pet lover aspiration in addition to the one we already have there is one lifetime aspiration one that creates permanent platinum status for having pet reach the top of their career chain i believe this one is a potential life time aspiration for fortune sims so the prospect wasnt completely ignored taking care of and training pet can be work if youre a glutton for punishment get a sim couple are still early in their career with a toddler to take care of then give them a male and female dog have the dog spawn puppy and then start a home business assuming you have open for business expansion if you accomplish this and keep everyone happy hat is to you bird and womrats work similar to the aquarium that already existed in the game though you can interact with them unlike the fish if you get busy with thing theyre easy to forget and they die even if you keep the food dish full bird can be taught to talk and they will fly around if you let them out of their cage not sure i put this paragraph in the con section i dont find the saltwater aquarium more exciting than the original onein summary this is indeed the best expansion pack yet for sims a scale of to i would give this a for fun alone the bug though not show stopper still led me to give it an overall score of star i still strongly recommend the game though the fun doe overcome the occasional frustration of the bug this one will easily keep me occupied the upcoming seasonalweather expansion im assuming every house will need a roof for more than cosmetic reason when that one come out,4,3,104,102,2006,11,14,1,2006-11-14

2902,A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ,B002I0H27E,tend divide fitness video game two category fun motion game like kinect star war kung fu live get workout course playing a game and pure exercise game designed the groundup to workout game in the world of pure fitness game far two contender the best the kinect shape fitness evolved and adidas micoachim happy to say that from ive seen far nike kinect training power way to the top of the list the accurate motion detection and interface of the workout game ive seen to date ha a truly innovative fitness test and put together workout routine that really feel personalized for youwhile the adidas game appearance animated version of recognizable athlete dwight howard and eric berry nike you have animated version of alex molden marie pervis best known a nike certified trainer although molden spend year in the nfl i found that fact that are actual trainer lends a bit credibility to the training a opposed to game hire big name athlete or pop star to drive salesthe concept of the game quite simple you start by selecting your goal such a get strong to increase your power and build explosiveness get toned to develop lean muscle and muscle definition or get lean to maximize calorie and fat burn you go a fitness assessment which youll get a customized circuit training routine to do the next four week in other video game i tried the assessment is really just smoke and mirrorshowever you do on your fitness test game give you the exact workout routine and call it a personalized one with nike kinect the workout i given really feel customized to exact goalsthe fitness challenge basically run you through a series of exercise using the kinect to measure both well your form is and how many rep of exercise youre youll see a video image of your animated trainer and a silhouette of next to or one thing to keep in mind is that you need a minimum of foot in front of your kinect sensor with a clear view of the floor and youll also need a good foot from left to right for certain exercise where youll be jumping from side to side edit have reported that foot is even enough for certain exercise in case you get stuck with the system unable to track you just use voice command xbox tracking to proceed with the exercise thanks to han for the tipeach exercise is similar in that youll see your trainer to the left of the screen and youll see a silhouette of your body to the right your silhouette will be orange first will glow blue youre using the correct form the kinect is extremely precise and did a great job of gauging whether i wa doing the exercise right each timethe first part of the assessment test your lower body and upper body mobility by you strike a pose first lying and raising each leg and then standing and stretching with your arm behind your backthe next part of the assessment ha you doing a variety of exercise from a hop and stick is the one that requires a ton of space from left to right a squat jump whats really cool this is that not the system judge your performance itll also give you detailed data that you try to beat each time you do the exercise for example the squat jump will tell you your vertical leap in inchestheres a cool exercise that test your speed reaction and agility where you have to hop and jump to various target on the ground youre also tested on squat pushup and high knee sprint i loved how you could set a benchmark and then try to beat it with each rep you do a bar on the bottom of the screen will show you how good your form is the more it fill up the better youre doing i also loved how the system displayed thing like time and rep it stylistically integrated into the background of the scenery in a way thats easy to read and ha a certain coolness factormotion sensing wa excellent something i always try to test with these kind of game i tried to throw it off several time but it seemed to do a great job of keeping up with meafter your evaluation youre given something called a unique fuel print interesting metric that track your fitness score on one side and your athleticism on the other side the test you basically establish a benchmark and then every four week youre given the same test to see how much youve improved i started with both number in the which i knew meant i had a lot of room for improvementyoure also set up with a custom week workout that focus on your goal a well a thing from your fitness evaluation that need improvement there a cool visual representation that show the system picking the right exercise for you the exercise in the workout routine are along the line of what i described doing various exercise where youre evaluated on how well your form and your execution are the virtual trainer doe give excellent feedback of your performanceat first i wa excited all the marketing material pointed to this game being tightly integrated into the whole nike system it turn out the integration is not very deep at all if you have a nike fuelband youll earn nikefuel playing this game just like you would doing any other exercise but other that there not direct connection interaction the fuelband and kinect training kinect training will sync in summary form to your nikepluscom profile so you can view your overall kinect training statistic on the site next to your fuelband statistic but thats itone thing i also love about the game is that it supported by kinect playfit so calorie burned will be counted along with all your other playfitcompatible gamesthe one thing i wish this title had wa more fun activity where you could get exercise by simulating real sport or activity this is something that other title such a your shape fitness evolved and ea sport active both have that provide some nice variety and diversion to keep the workout from getting monotonous nike training ha some of that there an interesting game where you need to move your body to avoid shattering a pane of glass thats coming toward you for the most part it still

2904,A2FUQ7N2L11PWP,B0050SXLQC,firstly would like say i almost ended buying game numerous negative review that slammed the game not bad game mean is a perfect game the game span separate campaign that run parallel time intersect campaign show a different vantage point of the main plot a global bioterrorist attack the gameplay is a third person action shooter horror element the control a great improvement the fifth installment opinion in it action game with control that slow the gamplay this time around the control are much intuitive move shooting and reloading well a melee an enemy at any time the story is good and each campaign reveals a bit more the terror attack caused and are thing that are not good the camera can sometimes a bit uncooperative and actually get too close to the character you cant see the enemy aiming at and since campaign overlap there are a section that you to play more with a different character to close re is a great game that i glad i didnt pas up and even though it may never live up to nostalgia of the first resident evil game and because the game are longer survival horror that is no reason to slam the game the way many reviewer have my advice is to give the game a chance rent it download the demo first you are really skeptical about it but defiantly give it a look and dont snuff if because of the negative review,5,3,34,27,2012,10,11,2,2012-10-11

2939,A3DZFEICHK5LF2,B009AGXH64,great news today nintendo released update resolved lot problem that the wii u personal favorite that download install game the background and fully automatically yes like that since the beginning three cheer ive updated my review reflect new informationoriginal review edited due to improvement nintendoi remember that nintendo came a lot of criticism an hd version of the wii hd around the first wii came and a lot of people a bit skeptical that stuck to the lower resolution hd became common nintendo told fan that they had to something come out an hd version of the wiiwell thats just nintendo the wii u is more than just wii hd nintendo hasnt changed the wii experience much you still use wii remote every time you play the wii u is not completely different like the wii wa when it came out the wii u is the wiis younger smarter brother and you liked the wii youll like the wii uthe main feature of the wii u hd brings it finally to speed with the xbox and playstation and everything else out the wii u a single video controller the video controller open up new game experience whoever is playing the video controller see something different than the player for generation people have wanted multiplayer game that didnt use a split tv screen and the wii u give you that in one console this is a really big deal the video controller is also a touchscreen which you use to flick something the screen move thing on screen the new video controller allows for new control option just like the wii balance board allowed nintendo to sell yoga and ski game video video video netflix youtube tivo amazon instant video it keep track of the tv show you want to watch and when they will on youll also be able to use the wii u a a social outlet to chat tv show and movie nintendo call this wii tvii and it would be a revolution in tv watching if the feature were available now you can use the wii u a a control for all video experience with your tv the video controller will act like pip picture in picture in the palm of your hand use the wii u with amazon video to watch movie for free and the wii remote let see information about the movie on imdb the movie is playing for sport youll be able to watch instant replay on the small screen while the rest of your buddy continue to watch the big game on the main screen so it going to be a remote controller on steroid to be honest this is going to be a really big big deal but since not all the feature roll later i cant give the wii u a star for it yet maybe it will change your life maybe not time will telland that concludes the main appeal of the wii u finally get hd the video controller add a new dimension to the usual wii gaming and it also serf a a tv command centerfaqsome people have asked me about the wii u and the short answer are you dont have to a wii to have a wii u you can only use one video controller with your wii u all other player use the old wii remote people can play at making it even more of a game party console than you cant play dvd or blu ray disc blue ray is sony playstation territory a you probably know you can surf the internet on it would you want to i dont know should i get the deluxe probably you get gb of memory which will become more important the longer you have the console and the more you do with it you get the nintendo land game you get the cradle for charging the video gamepad and until they will give you a store credit of every time you make a purchase of digital content game if you buy digital content regularly you might earn back the extra you pay for the deluxe wii u i tried this yesterday read for more info on the creditnintendolandnintendo land ha a nice set of game that introduce you to life with the video controller of the game are a lot of fun the popular minigames in house are the game one player pretend to be a ghost and scare other player this is accomplished by having two screen the ghost can see everyone but nobody else know where the ghost is this is always a howling good time at our house the mario hide and seek work the way and is also popular with u update a month of play the kid now play zelda and metroid the most some of the game would be worth about in an app store race game balloon game and yoshi game im talking to you some game have more than one control scheme the pikmin game is enjoyed by my year old can use a stylus to direct captain olimar instead of the joysticksdpads he just point at what he want to do so for the first time even my youngest can join in on at least some of the action metroid and zelda show what the wii u can do for multiplayer combatfps in metroid the player with the video controller operates a helicopter while everyone else are ground troop the two screen allow for different perspective in battlenintendoland ha satisfied my kid for a whole month but it really starting to wear off now nintendoland is particularly good if you have a lot of friend come to your house but it just a variety game and not very deep youll probably want to buy another game shortly after buying the wii u p i bought trine the nintendo eshop for but i think it wa worth about other game since i wrote my original review i have bought a lot of other wii u game however im generally disappointed in the use of the video controller in many game the video controller either show you a map of the area or show a version of whats on the big tv screen party game like the rabbids game and nintendo land make the best use of the video controller single player game tend to make the worst use of it i dont have all the game for the wii u but thats been my general experiencethe wii u ha a host of lesser feature a person can play the wii u without having the tv on expect a smack on your head if you want to play zombiu while your wife watch a movie it backwards compatible with all older wii game but maybe not dance pad which is nice if you bought zelda skyward sword this summer just a with the old wii you can download game from the nintendo store if you buy online content for your iphone xbox or p you know that this is a big deal i used to buy song for guitar hero to add to the song that came in the box if you buy this deluxe version you get a credit back for all online purchase see more about this credit in the bad below the wii u video controller is like a universal remote you can turn on your tv and change the volume from the gamepad which is a convenience most of the old wii hardware is compatible which is nice except that round gamecube style connector is not present on the wii u game that use a mat like outdoor challenge and dance dance revolution become history in your house there is a big easy to find download button for all digital content so if your wii u got fried by a power surge you wouldnt lose your purchase thats always nicethe bad the menu arent intuitive there are two menu the wii u menu and the home menu the home menu is found by pressing the home button note that now that downloads are automatic the unintuitive menu arent so bad but they still seem redundant transferring data from the wii to the wii u should be easier in particular i didnt like that when i imported my miis i had to do a separate step on the wii u before i could actually use in the game the day i got it the patch took way too long to download and install and after i transferred my data from my wii i felt like i had spent hour on the whole thing but since there ha been no problem freezing i did have a problem with nintendoland locking up but that went away after one day this will be something they fix and becomes a thing of the past i wouldnt sweat it long update i feel that the time that it take to download stuff and install it ha improved over time installing downloaded content i wrote a long rant about annoying this wa but a of the most recent update you can buy item in the store and they download and install automatically a they should digital content back ha a minimum and i feel that it high for every in digital content you get a credit if you spend on digital content then you still get until you spend another to get it to you go to a separate website using your computer and log in and then copy the code onto a piece of paper then you go to your wii u and put in the code ive become accustomed to the process and ive decided it not very restrictive but i still wish that credit just appeared in your account hour later the code are good until the code remain on that website even after youve used them they dont disappear when you add the code to the eshop there is no expiration dateok now that im done complainingyour decision matrix if you still like playing on your wii and you have the money to spend buy a wii u and sell your wii youll enjoy it if you are considering an xboxkinect and a wii u i think it a tough call i really like the second screen gaming it really open up a lot of possibility but most of the wii u stuff look really juvenile the kid the street told me he still wanted an xbox because the xbox ha game for teenager i said whatev a a side note every kid ha seen and played our wii u in the last two week ha put this a the top item on the christmas list it the next big thing for them and you can be sure that the little thing that i complain about in this review wont matter to them not at allgames nintendo now ha decent amount of digital content to buy online i paid for kirbys great adventure or something like that it a grainy looking old game but it wa only thirty five cent nintendo ha started offering game at the and price point a well im very pleased to see this because i want to be able to log the shop and grab a game for cheap when i want toi rate this item star out of because three star mean it ok nintendo ha made a lot of improvement in month and while they have fixed most of the problem with the system i find reluctant to raise the review to star until some more exclusive game are released pikmin ha been delayed until august for example month updateweve become heavy user of the wii u my wife who always preferred the kinect ha started to warm up to the wii u but i think it because my son is converting i sure couldntbig negative cradle and battery have limitation the battery on the video controller cant hold up to extended play i picked up one of cablesglobal game gear ggg deluxe split extension cable for wii u video controllerwhich resolved my problem now it easier to keep the video controller charged ive removed my rant about the video controller battery not lastingdownloads i removed my rant about problem with downloads because it been fixedthe wii u is getting better i think it may turn into my favorite console of all time if they can just get some good exclusive game out and improve the use of the video controller in game i really dont want another game where the wii u video controller show a map gimmie a break,3,3,994,889,2012,11,28,1,2012-11-28

2945,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B0056XXKIK,first hunting game past experience appears hunting game generally get middling low rating it seems like game maker simply resist including one monumental design flaw started the game the world tour stage of the great lake my first mission is to kill deer in minute avoiding killing taking moose attack horn first of i dont think moose generally attack rabidly second the more time they hit the more blood splatter on the screen may seem nice in theory but is annoying in game youre trying to pick out animal i failed my first time out partly i problem telling the difference a deer and a doe isnt a doe also a deer and partly because the movement rather clunkyi mean a hunter but i a mental image of hunting is like i imagine it involves a lot of searching waiting and patience probably holing in a location is difficult animal to spot what i dont imagine it involves is standing in the middle of a field firing animal a they run aimlessly the background are a static a a portrait not a blade of grass sway or a branch move and foot are cemented to the ground all you can is scan the landscape back and forth and over the animal look decent in still shot but their framerate is low and their movement are boring are no herd the animation sequence played over and over again snore cant hear nice sound of nature rather this bland soundtrackafter completing round of stage of great lake i went on to round where i needed to kill deer in while avoiding moose and wolf where the ramp for beginner this is hard in round of stage of great lake you need to tag direwolves in here the problem tagging doe not kill it tag while i am armed with dart i am defenseless attacking animalsyou can control with the stylus or circle pad although neither control scheme work the circle pad is fatally broken and unusable designed to start moving slow and speed up the you turn so at first you cant target animal because youre slow and then you fly right past it also it designed to continually snap to the center of the screen so targeting animal is pretty much impossible the sniper rifle is very difficult to use regardless of which control scheme you in one stage you need to hit deer from a distance but that mean finding a deer far enough away and i failed multiple time because apparently they too close then hit more while they zip back and forth your scope youre again defenseless against attack and the sniper rifle stubbornly refuse to target because it keep moving past your target pointi finally figured out the secret of the sniper rifle never use the scope this destroys the fun of a sniper rifle but it still better than the alternative of using this broken scope i managed to get to the trex fight and it just shined a spotlight on whats wrong with this game a if the control werent bad enough a if it wasnt annoying enough that animal are endlessly attacking you the dang trex would stomp and roar shaking the ground and throwing your aim trying to retarget with this broken control scheme is just an exercise in frustration rather than fun this game felt like a chore i had to endure to get through this review i really cant recommend this to anyone including hunting fan since there surely are better hunting game available,2,3,8,6,2012,7,23,2,2012-07-23

2993,A8N0WM620H8RP,B001VJ4DHK,playing mass effect known expect mass effect me i have to admit i blown away production value game this truly one of the immersive game ive ever played thanks small part to the cinematic cutscenes voiced dialogue wellwritten storyline far a the way the game progress basically identical to me the dialogue system is the the somewhat misleading option make say something almost completely different but add new feature interrupt certain sequence icon flash the screen sometimes a paragon action sometimes for a renegade action and you click the appropriate mouse button in time commander shepard will interrupt the dialogue and perform an action sure to keep hand on the mouse and be readywhere the game differs from me in a way that really streamlines the entire experience a you may have already heard is no conventional inventory to deal with rather you use weapon locker on the normandy and sometimes placed within a mission to assign weapon to your squad member in shepard private quarter on the normandy you can change your armor but there many choice of weapon armor to speak of so the maintenance is minimal squad member cant change armor except that eventually you can change appearance but not in a way that affect their ability it purely cosmetic one nice touch is that weapon use the same ammunition so youll never need to search for specific type of ammo anymorethe way skill point work also changed the level cap of you will end with point you spend point on or power and power ha rank the final rank unlocks your choice of one of two possible evolved version that are powerful such a the choice a powerful version of pull or pull field affect a group of enemy the power assigned to each class have also changed from the first game so be sure to review the difference choosing a class even if you import your me save game you can choose a new class before beginning the gamenow said all that i still have one big complaint the game and it actually similar to the complaint i made about me the way me is structured is thus after the initial event you are given two or three recruitment mission during which you pick up new squad member after these mission the next big step of the main story becomes available after this part is done you are given another handful of recruitment mission which again must be done before the next part of the main mission is availabledont get me wrong the individual mission are fun welldesigned and offer plenty of diversity of gameplay but at the same time almost felt like filler between the main mission of the story just a in me the actual main plot mission of me really are quite short and dont account for the majority of the game there are recruitment mission for almost every squad member dont join you from the beginning and subsequently each squad member ha a loyalty mission which is optional but very useful to and again they are wonderfully designed but if you count up the actual number of mission that deal directly with the main story there are about four or five each lasting hoursi understand that it is necessary to do mission to recruit your squad member but i didnt necessarily like that doing wa a prerequisite for advancing the plot what that amounted to wa doing a lot of what felt like side quest the main quest wa intentionally postponed of course i want to do these recruitment mission but it would have been better if allowed to do them at the same time a we progressed in the main storyline in other word pick up a squad member we want then do a main mission quest or two then go back and do another recruitment mission but a the game is designed you have to do these other mission first before you are allowed to progress the main story it ha the effect of making the main story seem sparse and spread thin across the span of the gamebut i give me five star simply it wa superbly designed and massively enjoyable i cant wait to play me,5,3,0,0,2010,11,11,1,2010-11-11
2994,A2VGLAC97CUVWS,B00001X50L,look back when i bought game well a several great game i cant remember exactly inspired buy what i know i kept it suikoden is best game the suikoden series also one the greatest role playing game to ever grace the market the story is rich immersive the character memorable and iconic and the battle system is classical perfectionthe game put in control of one of the two main character although best friend opposing destiny when country betrays excuse to go to war the two start path to try and find their place in the world trapped the home betrayed them and their sworn enemiesa lot happens the course of the story not unlike the drastic change that would take place during a war yet the story never stretch thin it keep you interested in every step to the final confrontation the game also take advantage of genius war tactic that used in actual campaign in history a part of the storythere are also the customary character that are collected the game are support character that add function to army and dimension to your base castle and of them are playable character that you use in battle of the character even shortly introduced are memorable and full of dimension that are sometimes established only a short sentence even in situation the character are rich with life making this perhaps the best cast in suikoden game each character is animated in an animeesque style make sense it a japanese game even if you are not a fan of the style of art it is the perfect face for the game when you see it togetherthe battle system in the game is traditional rpg turn based format they use the turn based system to perfection are six character on screen in the front row in the back character in front can attack freely but character in the back row can only attack if they have long range weapon such a a bow character that share some kind of history know similar fighting style can team up to do combined special move move range being simply entertaining to completely devastating charactes who cant attack from the back row can still function a fighter if they have a combo attack with another character this add a well rounded strategic element to the set up of a conventional group since character with combo attack usually need to in the row or in the same column to perfom their attacksi have beaten this role playing game multiple time and still find it a entertaining a the first day i picked it up it is truly a gilded great and thats not just a funny phrase anyone who looked for this game in recent year ha probably found it ranging from to i will certainly say i grateful i never sold this game and if you ever obtain it you will not be disappointed,5,3,6,6,2006,7,12,2,2006-07-12

3010,A1X2URS71RRMMF,B00DAIUIPG,fornicates aleksandr voinov la wittarc supplied netgalleyi love romance whether gay hetero doesnt matter long story good love thats whats important decent plot is the first book ive read the market garden series though ive read another novella from riptide and pleased the quality so began this expecting quality writing knowing nothing of the series storyline and charactersits difficult to pick though i quickly realised the background and that nick is a university student working a high end establishment a a dom rent to support thats worked fine for in the past but he entered a relationship with a former client he finding the work uni partner balance is leaving him confused and tired he not sure to need the job to support uni and doesnt want to give up fledgling relationship with spencer and need uni for his future career the current job is a filler not a life long plan spencer seems to dominating his thought he not with him and distracting him from concentrating his client and that not good for or his reputationits a great book draw on the strength and weakness of character and difficult it be in a new relationship add to that nick job and the jealousy that may occur and spencer is a gem he so understanding and the the pressure spencer himself is a lawyer and still not a high powered stressful bullying environment he work and if he out himself he afraid thing get worseits a shortish book page and yet each word seems to carefully crafted and is so much detail and info in page fluff and filler just excellent plot and people i got caught up in the conundrum nick found himself in and wondered what id do if i wa him spencer wa heartbreaking at time in his clear love for nick and his suggestion for what he could do even close to the end i couldnt work out what nick would finally choose i understood his reaction to spencer suggestion and wa so glad it worked out the way it i enjoy the psychology of novel like this the mental strain of the balance of life a a gay what is perceived a normal the way others react the difficulty that cause in contrast with people in a conventional unit relationship take work but being gay seems to me to cause additional problem and although thats tough in real life it make for cracking novel all thats read we dont want just a sweet hea love story but one where the character have to work for solution undergo at time real heartbreak in that search but hopefully end up in a situation that suit them all there sex in this book of course but written in a way that it not overly graphic or tacky but just really sensual and loving feeling a if it integral part of the duo and not something tacked on to spice up the book a so often happens it sex thats relevant to the story and the coupleit seems to me riptide and the combination of aleksandr voinov and la witt have hit a winning series here if the rest is a good a this book and id love to read from them it is quite expensive at for page but clearly two author have a devoted following well earned and it not a padded novel it all relative and id rather have le page and have them specific to the book one that page and page of irrelevancy thats get boring and can be skipped it one for keeper file for reading so that add to the value for money scalestars it an excellent five star read from a team that certainly know how to write riveting and sensual romance if love a good mm love story this book is to be recommended,5,4,1,1,2013,6,19,2,2013-06-19

to save her unfortunately what he must barter away to save her life plague the couple for all their time togetherof all charlotte boyettcompos reaper series the exciting and emotionally stirring westernwind series is one of top two favorite the combination of the futuristic flavor mixed with old west gunslinger dressed all in black with laser whip and sixshooters and paranormal vampire werewolf element truly make for fascinating tale tear of the reaper book four in the series is my absolute series favorite with book one wyndriver sinner coming in a close second though all the book in the series have a dark fantasy flavor tear of the reaper ha a number of disturbing scene of violence against rachel that tear the heart out and will make mad a hell so be prepared a always the sex scene are sensual creating a loving connection between rachel and owen the secondary character been seen in the previous three book are a threedimensional a everthis book also display m boyettcompos unique ability to present both the strength and weakness of her character everyone who read the series know what awful thing happened to owen in book prime reaper a a result he experiencing what know a ptsd he in considerable emotional pain and finding his memory of his torture too difficult to live with without the numbing aid of more and more tenerse he find himself suffering the effect of tenerse poisoning his story is harrowing and poignant and even a he recovers from his poisoning life continues to hand him one emotionally painful consequence after another but all he find a love so strong it make the pain and what he ha to give to save rachel bearable and worthwhilealthough this book can stand alone highly recommend reading this series in order a each reaper character building continues from book to book much of owen back story can be found in prime reaper likewise much of m boyettcompos underlying world building is better understood a she build upon it throughout her

3453,A10WKHGNMX5VTX,B009VSVWHW,another review rating starswhen ex con jeremy stillson end begging money street corner boulder colorado idea life change he spy looming figure rance crawford heading towards the nearby yarn shop instead of money rance offer him a job that come a small room to call his in the alpaca barn fiber mill that rance owns is the chance jeremy ha wanted a way to honest and to go straight leaving the illegal lifestyle behind that he learned from his conman of a father a father died when a con went badbut living a honest life doesnt necessarily mean jeremys past is gone with the old lifestyle rance turn jeremys training to a young gorgeous man named aiden a master color and yarn dye even a teenager aiden is everything jeremy ha always wanted to be and jeremy idolizes the teenager from the first moment meet year year jeremy slowly adjusts he learns to love his new life he learns to knit and gain a family with the people he work with at the alpaca ranch and importantly he fall in love with aiden a aiden age and matures a wonderful young manjeremys feeling of insecurity and low self esteem never gone away and when aiden start to return his affection jeremy is petrified jeremys first instinct to run rabbit away aiden ha jeremy figured when aiden first met jeremy one of the thing he taught him how to hold a angora rabbit to make feel secure it be petted and brushed so when jeremy show sign of rabbiting away aiden know exactly he ha to to keep the one man he ha wanted from running away and make him trust in aidenwhat a wonderful story be the first to admit that amy lane is a go to author for amy lane book to me mean an outpouring of human emotion from character so real i expect to meet on the street an amy lane story mean that the situation and event character find entangled in come across so authentic so genuine that empathy but my heart is engaged from the beginning they weep i find sobbing along a well and when they find joy then my heart feel replete with happinesshow to raise an honest rabbit knitting brings back the character learned to love in the winter courtship ritual of furbearing critter knitting present and accounted for are rance crawford owner of the alpaca farm and yarn mill ben mccutcheon rances lover and neighbor aiden fabric designer extraordinaire and ariadne shop manager and spinner and of course jeremy the first story in the knitting series gave u rance and ben courtship from pov with the character circling around like satellite albeit family member satellite and a much a we learned to love ariadne and rory her husband it wa jeremy and aiden we kept returning to and we wanted to know their story and thankfully amy lane give u that and in how to raise an honest rabbitit wa hysterical to see rance and ben meeting and courtship from the other side so to speak a rances meeting with jeremy predates ben moving in next door but the heart of story is jeremy his pain born out of his past and his slow emergence into the man he wanted to be but never thought possible jeremys history is heartbreaking in that amy lane way mean the angst of his past is brought vividly home to the reader but in small subtle way that build over the length of the story into a horrific portrait of a young boy lost to society at the earliest of age we learn in tiny increment about the jar of peanut butter jeremy ha stashed so he always ha something to eat and the true reason he talk so much yet value silence and the awful fact that jeremy doesnt even know his real name the story is told from jeremys pov which is so important a we hear his thought about his life his panic attack his growing affection for aiden and everyone else around himand a we learn about jeremy we are also creating a strong picture of aiden a well from aidens interaction with rance overheard conversation and his talk with jeremy we watch a young fiber genius mature into a man who realizes that patience and perhaps ear plug are the way to capture the skittish man he ha fallen in love with it wa aidens careful loving interaction with jeremy that made me fall in love with aiden completely and with ariadne a well really is an endless stream of gem that i could be quoting from the story but that would take away of the magic to be found from discovering them on own a i didand finally a a knitter myself i loved every aspect of knitting that appears here from the carding machine noise to the method ariadne used to teach jeremy to knit and his own rhyme he made up there are the dye vat color card and description of how the colored strand can be spun in different manner ending up a completely different yarn and i dont think have to be a knitter to find this information fascinating it just is but i love the pattern for the fingerless mitten at the end yes i did and will try my hand at making a set this winterthere is another knitting series book on the horizon knitter in his natural habitat knitting johnny and stanley story i cant wait in the meantime i will just shuffle and reload winter courtship ritual back onto my kindle and start from the beginning more a i waithere is the order the book written and be

to tell youin interest full disclosure this review get underway it need to be known that i actually friend gina maxwell making that statement isnt one of oh arent i special thing it needed to be said before i let my thought regarding the latest installment of fighting for love series roam free told me that she wa writing character that wa a victim of sexual abuse i cringed a bit she writes romance steamy romance shes damn good itif youve the privilege of reading seducing cinderella rule of entanglement you know this her hero are strong and sexy and her heroine are actually likable this a huge thing for me when it come to romance nothing put a sour taste in my mouth quite like a milquetoast woman that swoon just because the hero say she i knew that when it came time for book number three it would be amazing but i previously stated when it wa set that the heroine would a background riddled with moment that human should live i felt my stomach turn i didnt doubt that she could pull it in the least gina is one of those author that labor every word she writes every syllable meaning i wa worried wa actually reading itin the interest of yet disclosure i wa a victim of sexual and domestic abuse this isnt a sob story about me that is just an important piece of the review im a ten year survivor and am always anxious to encourage people to stand up and speak living through something like rape and physical battery is something that one eventually come to term with but are still scar scar that you fight like hell nearly every day to get over when it come to learning to love or even more arduous learning to love youre fighting an uphill battle one that need to be handled carefully patiently and passionatelykat macgregor is the human equivalent of a bait dog abused in the worst possible way every move she make is calculated and every moment is spent looking over her shoulder working a hopeless job in a dive bar with survival in mind shes confronted with a looming debt that her pathetic excuse for an exboyfriend owes to a notsonice man that make money peddling drug and exploiting woman constantly avoiding her sister the one person that could help her out of the louisiana swamp and wipe her slate clean kat eventually find trusting in aiden irish obrien the bar bouncer little she know that wa sent there her sister fianceacute the hero gina maxwell nd book to keep an eye herbut irish doe more keep an eye on her throughout the narrative see that he is just a scarred but from dramatically different cut a former mma fighter irish blame his fist and his temper for the accidental death of his best friend sister because of this guilt he refuse to get close to anyone but there is something about kat that settle deep his soul and he go and beyond to protect her to save her life irish doe the one thing he swore he would never again fightas the hero is based on the obnoxiously aesthetically pleasing adam von rothfelder picturing irish wa easypeasy but what make the character quite literally the sexiest man ive ever seen on paper is his attitudeno one ever asks to fall in love with someone that ha more baggage than a kardashian and when irish discovers the abuse that kat ha survived the reader literally see switch gear a man that wa interested in keeping her safe and maybe engaging in horizontal action doe everything in his power to bring kat out of the shadow it no longer becomes about him and his need yes there is sex in this book oh mother is there sex and it melt panty and possibly whatever surface you are sitting on it is hot but every interaction is meaningful every single solitary lick and touch is irish way of showing kat that not every man hurt her and that sex be about her not the person thats using her but actually her the dialogue the two of is scintillating and refreshing it isnt just hey my dick is hard and you know you want me to place it somewhere in person there actual conversation real meaningful everyday people working way over a hurdle together conversation the tenderness between character is unbelievablewhat is more magical about this book is that gina capture kat journey from broken to beautiful in the glorious way the reader will actually watch her transform and the only word that i can use to describe it is autobiographical there entire paragraph from kat point of view i had to put the book and take a deep breath because i felt like i wa reading a diary it hurt but it wa the best kind of hurt because it wa illuminating abuse survivor run the gamut of emotion and one of the most damaging is their willingness to blame for the bad thing that happened to them kat morphs from a terrified caterpillar in an iron cocoon to the most spectacular butterflyfighting for irish is the kind of book everyone deserves to read there is joy there is pain there is sex i mention the sex ducttape your ear shut because your brain may possibly melt and trickle out that goodive used a plethora of word in this review but really the only one that count are these this book is spectacular ginas reader and anyone who love alpha with huge heart will now have a new favorite in their library were this book not already perfect i would love it simply because of the dedication gina dedicates it to victim of sexual abuse encouraging them to never stop fightingthis book is a manifesto giving the broken a glimpse to that someday when if keep fighting and never loose hope their irish will happen tooless,5,4,2,2,2014,1,13,1,2014-01-13

3563,A1FEBL7652SEPS,B004SYA76Q,received author reviewnote review often contain spoilersmarina start senior year high school new school the first shes ever actually attended for the first time without her dad to support her marina father is a agronomist who spending the year in afghanistan to help develops way to feed country marina is going to aptos california to live her aunt abby and her cousin cruz in their little seaside town belief her life is she encounter a sexy boy named ethan and ethereal mermaid name lorelei soon shes drawn the little seaside town and the mystery of the ocean border embarking a dangerous quest to find she is and she come from she survive to discover the answer she seeksthe summary isnt the best description of the book lately seem to find staring a blank screen forever to try to find the right word to summarize and review the book ive read i dont know a blog thats creating loss for word in my writing just temporary mental block but hopefully it go away soon anyway back to the reviewthis book is really of a star but i dont half rating since i copy my review to my different profile it easier to stay with solid star since thats the site use i actually found two thing i think detracted from what is an otherwise well written and interesting story however one of them just big that it dropped my rating considerablythe first thing that bothered and this is actually the smaller one wa that the character seemed to this inside joke that wa never explained to the reader there multiple scene with giggling character where i didnt really understand what wa so funny to the character in this novel there apparently something hilarious about the statement thats what she said i didnt get it and there nothing worse than on the outside of a joke okay well there is but it still suck youre left outthe thing that i thought wa the major flaw with this book wa the mary sue tendency of the character and their lifestyle werent quite perfect but they darn close at first i wasnt going to ding this book so hard for this but it wa her father winning the nobel prize that kind of put it over the top for me marina traveled extensively attending online school her father is only a brilliant agronomist a job that to honest id never heard of reading this book but also hold a faculty position at a prestigious university apparently he powerful enough that marina get her way on her class just mentioning name to the school guidance counselorshe is brilliant and is only attending high school because her father feel shes independent and need to learn to be around her peer it pretty apparent that one really expects her to learn anything new academically there let not forget thats shes beautiful and mystical wellher neighbor who pretty much adopted her to the point shes referred to a aunt evie is a retired fashion model who dress marina is prada and other top of the line designer just because she enjoys it if that werent enough with this flamboyant character she ha a basement full of expensive car that she let marina learn to drive on and oh shes the original fashion it girl not to mention the fabulous evie spends her time searching out hidden talent in fashion and music and helping them succeed in the business i seriously need an aunt evieher cousin cruz though a social outcast is a brilliant but a of yet undiscovered fashion designer his best friend meghan is a song writer with the amazing voice and cant forget that evan the boy who fall for marina is the hottest and most respect guy in school he the best surfer on the beach work all the time to achieve his future and adores the perfect marinai planned to mention this from about the introduction of aunt evie but i hadnt planned to make a big of a deal of it in my review until dad the nobel prize thats just what put it over the top for me the only negative thing really in the character life is that ethan doesnt have a lot of money and his mother ran when wa only a kid cruz is a social outcast and believe his father died in a car crash when he wa a baby only to learn later that his father wa a married man who tried paying his mother to abort meghan is overweight and also a social outcast and finishing out the social outcast crew is marina who mother died in child birth it a if the writer ha found a couple flaw she like and just attributed them to every characterthe book however is extremely well written fast paced and a quick and enjoyable read the plot ha some interesting twist and turn that keep reader turning the page the only thing i think the writer need to learn is that perfect character may lead wonderful life but it harder for a reader to relate to character whose life they envy than a character who ha just a many issue a they do overall though i really enjoy reading this book and i would recommend it to others who enjoy young adult urban fantasy novel it an excellent debut novel from a writer i look forward to reading more of there an obvious

3896,AEXAZUTT4LQI3,B00DJVQ6AU,actual rating starsi quite enjoy find intriguing prophecy deciding destiny trope book kelly orams chameleon proved little le mesmerizing and lot frustrating a satisfied reader to say the leastthe backdrop chameleon full of supernatural of every race warlock witch vampire werewolf seer and demon much the paranormal read and yet is a unique charm to familiarity i enjoyed much the beginning start promising enough dani heroine turning sixteen and finding that not is best friend rus a warlock is a supernatural a well with her special ability coupled with the straightforward not overly complicated romance dani and rus setup the perfect entertaining storyline initially this is the sort of book that is easy to get absorbed in however is the latter morethan half of the book dani get kidnapped the council of supernatural that provided a steady decline in the amusing factorwith it familiar idea it come a surprise that there would be something off the story despite the homey feeling stirred with the paranormal creature that inhabit it world the worldbuilding is really nothing special it a little bit of modernlifestyle thrown together with a very subtle historic feeling when the council of supernatural is introduced there is a lot of room future development i think the story could benefit for the rest of the series other that the world is neither interesting worth remembering perhaps somewhere in betweenthe plot isnt much better off after the kidnapping the story pick quite rapidly in it emerging event and not in a good way much happening in the span of feel like all of ten minute dani get kidnapped the council is introduced the seer is introduced the prophecy told all with the love triangle the center of attention the storyline soon becomes overcrowded with unexpected plot twist and turn which in another story presented a different way i would have jumped at the chance to talk about but not with this too much unnecessary angst and the endless description and overcomplications of every decision dani make the epic and mysterious plot that the description offer is unfortunately reduced to a tedious banalitymore than the plot dull it is the love triangle that made this read so frustrating for and perhaps the only book i wholeheartedly favour the second guy the first rus it for me with easy goingdemeanor and his loyalty towards dani to the point where his character is the only character that garnered sympathy and affection from me i loved dani and rus and the bestfriendstolovers romance is a favourite of mine which is when gabriel the seer is brought the picture i lost all semblance of open mind about this book the love triangle failing played in part to all the extreme change in the story dani go from being a snarky intelligent girl to a helpless blindbylove fool the romance is cheesy confusing and definitely not worth rooting for i couldnt wrap head around the gabrieldani couple all i did not come to appreciate gabriel character no spunk no allure rather he come across a meek not a character that get my immediate attention by the middleend of the story i found it difficult to invest in any of the character and ultimately gave up trying to find a final redeeming quality there is a lot more that could be said for the impossibility that this love triangle is but to sum it up it is beyond frustratingwith that said i believe chameleon is the type of read that work only for people have the right mindset and patience for a love triangle and all the conflicting emotion that it brings if not for that addition to the storyline this could have been a worthwhile read nonetheless despite my reservation i still hoping that ungifted will prove to be what it predecessor is not memorable with no i wish a little a possible mention of the love triangle keeping my finger crosseda copy wa provided by the author for review,2,4,0,0,2014,5,27,2,2014-05-27
